speaker_unknown: W-what is that?! That girl… Is she some kind of monster?!
speaker_unknown: That’s… That’s the Twilight Star! She’s going to destroy the entire city! W-what do we do?!
speaker_unknown: Wait… Who are those…?
speaker_unknown: Are those people fighting her?
speaker_unknown: Are they… trying to save us…? They’re… incredible!
----------
speaker_kaisa: Ugh…
speaker_kaisa: That vision again… Why is it happening so often, lately?
speaker_kaisa: …Ah, no sense dwelling on it now.
speaker_ina: **AGGRESSIVE CHEEP!**
speaker_kaisa: Ugh, so loud! Ina, why?!
speaker_ina: […Oh, you’re awake! Perfect! Remember, there are only a few weeks left before the school year starts.]
speaker_kaisa: Don’t remind me.
speaker_ina: [I will absolutely remind you, bunny! We still have to finish your Star Guardian training!]
speaker_ina: [Only a few lessons left to go before you're ready to protect the universe! Yay!]
speaker_kaisa: So loud… So early… Ina, please…
speaker_ina: [“Ina, please start my training right now?” Sure thing, bunny! Let’s begin with some trivia.]
speaker_kaisa: Fine. I… guess some morning training couldn’t hurt.
speaker_ina: [Perfect! Choose the response you think fits best, and I’ll respond in kind. Don’t worry, there are no wrong answers! Be yourself!]
speaker_ina: [What is the job of a Star Guardian?]
	[Option 1] To protect the world from darkness!
	speaker_ina: [That’s right, bunny!]
	speaker_ina: [Although… it's been a while since anything bad happened.]
	speaker_ina: [But that’s no reason to start slacking off!]
	[Option 2] To fight for my friends!
	speaker_ina: [That’s right, bunny!]
	speaker_ina: [Your friends are your greatest strength! Well, besides the First Star.]
	speaker_ina: [So treat them all well, and keep them safe!]
	[Option 3] I’m going back to bed.
	speaker_ina: [H-hey!]
	speaker_kaisa: Yawn… back to bed…
	speaker_ina: [Y-you can’t do that! It’s against the rules! Hey, wake up! Hey! HEY!!!]
	speaker_kaisa: I’m kidding, Ina. Jeez, stop yelling.
	speaker_ina: [Sorry, bunny! I’m naturally very loud!]
speaker_kaisa: Right, I think I’ve got it.
speaker_kaisa: What’s next? Can we move to combat training?
speaker_ina: [You sure do like fighting! But first, let's talk about navigation. Being a strong fighter is useless if you can’t get to the battle in time!]
speaker_ina: [Your star phone has a special interface, updated by yours truly. Let's take a look now.]

Chapter 1 Act 1
----------
speaker_unknown: [It’s just like before…]
speaker_unknown: [Back when… everything changed…]
----------
speaker_zoe: Back when this happened?!
speaker_zoe: I had so much fun! All those people, gone forever! And you were right in the middle of it!
speaker_zoe: What’s wrong? You don’t want to remember!? Well, too bad!
speaker_zoe: You couldn’t do anything to save the city then! And you can’t do anything now!
speaker_zoe: I see you, Kai’Sa! You can never hide from me!
speaker_zoe: I SEE YOU, KAI’SA! KAI’SA!
----------
speaker_unknown: Kai’Sa? Kai’Sa! Stop daydreaming, we’re trying to train!
----------
speaker_kaisa: Oh… sorry, I forgot where I was for a second.
speaker_akali: Forgot!? You made us come out here, Kai! This isn’t exactly where I want to be on the last day of spring vacation!
speaker_akali: I thought I would spend every day at the arcade…! So cruel.
	[Option 1] You’ll be glad we trained if monsters attack.
	[Option 2] Video games won’t help you in a life-or-death situation, Akali.
	[Option 3] You haven’t named a single one of your special attacks! This team is shameful.
speaker_akali: Pff, whatever. Nothing’s attacked this city since we took the oath.
speaker_akali: Which is fine by me, thanks for asking. I’d rather not relive last year!
speaker_ekko: It’s better to be prepared, ‘Kali. Plus I can test out my powers on old stop signs.
speaker_kaisa: More testing, huh? Is that what you do when you skip training?
speaker_ekko: Hm. I’m sure I have no idea what you’re talking about… captain.
speaker_sona: ...
speaker_chiizu: Sona says you can do it, Ekko! Believe in yourself!
speaker_sona: ...!
speaker_chiizu: Ahhh! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to editorialize!
speaker_kaisa: Heh. This team’s lively as ever.
speaker_chiizu: She’s gone mad with rage! Every mouse for themselves!
speaker_ekko: Sona! You’re not supposed to hit your familiar like that! You have to go for their center of mass!
speaker_sona: ...!
speaker_kaisa: One day, that mouse is really gonna get it.
speaker_taliyah: Captain! I’m pumped from training and can’t wait to sock a big monster right in its monster face!
speaker_kaisa: Good to hear, Taliyah. By the way… you act really differently when you wear that uniform. It’s refreshing.
speaker_taliyah: Thanks! I feel more like myself in the outfit.
speaker_taliyah: Star power! Chu chu!
speaker_akali: Hey, Tali. Sona’s about to fight her own mouse.
speaker_taliyah: What?! The battle of the titans is happening?! Two enter, one leaves?! Oh, I can’t miss this!
speaker_akali: Go get ‘em, tiger.
speaker_akali: …You’re sure you’re okay, Kai? You looked kinda pale for a minute. Need to talk?
	[Option 1] It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.
	speaker_akali: Hm… You sure?
	speaker_akali: Well, no use worrying about it then!
	speaker_akali: If you wanna talk about it later, though… All you have to do is ask. I’m always here for you.
	[Option 2] I was thinking about last year…
	speaker_akali: Oh… The invasion…
	speaker_akali: It’s tough. We’re all still… processing. Kind of crazy how fast they rebuilt the damaged parts of the city, though.
	speaker_kaisa: Sometimes, I remember all those people, and… Ugh, well, you know. You were there, too.
	[Option 3] Who would win in a fight, me or a big robot made of smaller robots?
	speaker_akali: How big is the robot? If it’s a really big robot, the robot wins. If it’s a slightly smaller robot… 50/50.
	speaker_akali: Or… Hmm… In that mecha show, the big train robot beat up a dinosaur. Can you beat up a dinosaur? I’m not so sure.
	speaker_akali: …30/70, robot’s favor. Sorry.
speaker_akali: Actually, Kai… I did want to ask you something…
speaker_akali: Now that people know about the guardians… or, the old ones—not us, obviously, since we haven’t done anything yet…
speaker_akali: How long before this all ends? All of us, out here, having fun together?
speaker_akali: What if Zoe comes back? Or something even worse? What happened to the other guardians won’t happen to us… will it?
speaker_taliyah: Uh-oh, the sun’s starting to go down! Get back up there, sun!
speaker_taliyah: Team? The sun isn’t listening to me. Should we call it?
speaker_ekko: Seems like the right move. I have to get back to my… uh… Well, I gotta get back.
speaker_ekko: Hey, Sona. And Sona’s mouse… thing. What do you think? Training over?
speaker_sona: …
speaker_chiizu: She says she’ll race you down the hill! And that you know what my name is!
speaker_sona: ...!
speaker_chiizu: …What? OH, NO! IS THAT NOT WHAT YOU SAID?!
speaker_chiizu: MISS SONA, PLEASE! I’M A FACET OF YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS! MISS SONA! AAAAHHHHH!
speaker_taliyah: Hey, no fair! That’s a huge head start!
speaker_ekko: Geez. These kids.
speaker_kaisa: Kids, huh?
speaker_akali: Aren’t you all the same age?
speaker_ekko: It’s a mindset, ‘Kali. That’s why I’m the genius inventor, and they’re all a bunch of goofy kids. As out of touch second years, I don’t expect you to understand.
speaker_akali: Yesterday, you spent a hundred dollars entering a fighting game tournament and got last place.
speaker_ekko: Wow! Wow! I do not recall that experience!
speaker_ekko: I’m so offended that I need to leave this discussion immediately. Bye!
speaker_akali: Hey, wait!
speaker_akali: Pff, the second I showed him up...
speaker_kaisa: At least they’re punctual about something. Come on. We should head out too. I don’t want to run into those middle-aged joggers again.
speaker_akali: Ugh, good call. Their wraparound sunglasses are… not attractive.
----------
speaker_akali: Anyway, Kai… I didn’t get to finish my thought.
----------
speaker_akali: …Do you really think monsters will attack the city again? We haven’t seen any in… well, since the Battle of the Twilight Star.
speaker_kaisa: Hm? Oh… right…
	[Option 1] It’s hard to say.
	speaker_kaisa: I wish I had a better answer.
	speaker_kaisa: If they do… we just have to be ready.
	[Option 2] No use thinking about it now.
	speaker_kaisa: Just assume we’ll have to fight at some point, Kali.
	speaker_kaisa: If we’re lucky, it’ll be against some small fry.
	[Option 3] What about a small robot made of bigger robots? Could I beat that?
	speaker_kaisa: I’m very serious about this.
	speaker_akali: Hey, come on. Stop joking around.
speaker_kaisa: Sigh… I wish the old guardians would come back. They would know what to do.
speaker_akali: Kai…
speaker_kaisa: Hey, it’s alright! Whatever happens, we have each other! Star Guardians stick together. That’s our whole thing.
speaker_akali: Yeah, I know. I know! Guardians forever, best friends for life.
speaker_kaisa: Best friends for life!
speaker_kaisa: And nothing will ever change that. Not monsters, not being Star Guardians, nothing. No matter what.
speaker_akali: …No matter what, huh?
speaker_kaisa: Yep!
----------
speaker_kaisa: No matter what.
----------
Chapter 1 Act 2
----------
speaker_unknown: Ah… Akali…
speaker_unknown: It’s… so… hea… vy… Akali…
----------
speaker_kaisa: …Ugh, It feels like I’ve been in school for a thousand years.
speaker_kaisa: How did we get Instructor Puboe for homeroom? It’s like I’m in prison.
speaker_akali: I dunno. I think I could take him.
speaker_akali: Transform into a Star Guardian. Throw, like, a hundred knives. And then I’d say something cool, like, um...
speaker_akali: “Take that, Puboe! You’ll never assign six-page essays on a Friday again!”
speaker_akali: I dunno, what do you think?
	[Option 1] Don’t joke about using your powers like that.
	speaker_akali: Ugh, yeah, I know.
	speaker_akali: When did you get so serious? You never want to joke around anymore.
	speaker_kaisa: I can joke. Just not about abusing our powers. The guardians would never do that.
	[Option 2] We can’t transform to hurt civilians. Even a villain like Puboe.
	speaker_akali: Ugh, yeah, I know.
	speaker_akali: When did you get so serious? You never want to joke around anymore.
	speaker_kaisa: I can joke. Just not about abusing our powers. The guardians would never do that.
	[Option 3] …And then everyone claps?
	speaker_akali: Haha. Very funny.
	speaker_kaisa: No, I’m sure they would. And a little parade would march in front of the school, and you’d get to meet the mayor.
	speaker_kaisa: But seriously, don’t joke about using your powers like that. We’re supposed to be the good guys.
speaker_akali: …Fine. I wasn’t really going to.
speaker_kaisa: By the way, are you training with us this weekend? You haven’t been around the past few weeks… I’ve been worried.
speaker_akali: Oh, yeah… Maybe next time. I’m trying to catch up on some stuff…
speaker_kaisa: Akali, come on. What if monsters attack? What if the city is in danger?
speaker_akali: …Yeah, I know, but…
speaker_kaisa: Everyone remembers Lux and Ahri and their squads. There are statues of them. We have a responsibility to protect people.
speaker_kaisa: Are you just going to skip your training and let everyone down?
speaker_akali: Let everyone down…?
speaker_akali: Let everyone down?! What are you talking about?!
speaker_akali: I train with you all the time. All you care about anymore is being a Star Guardian! I thought you said nothing was going to change between us!
speaker_kaisa: W-what?! Hey, we’re both leaders here!
speaker_akali: Leaders?! Who cares! When was the last time we hung out outside of stupid training!?
speaker_kaisa: We’re hanging out now!
speaker_akali: We’re walking home from school, and you’re still making it about being a guardian! You won’t even let me crack a joke!
speaker_kaisa: I… grrr!
speaker_kaisa: You know what? You’re right. You are right.
speaker_akali: I… am?
speaker_kaisa: I’m sorry… I just…
speaker_kaisa: Kali… Have you been seeing things recently? Visions of the invasion?
speaker_akali: The invasion...? Zoe’s invasion?
speaker_kaisa: I haven’t been sleeping well since school started. If I focus on the team, it’s… easier to deal with.
speaker_akali: ...
speaker_akali: Kai, I’ve been seeing things too. Hearing things.
speaker_akali: I keep thinking about that night last year… all those people…
speaker_akali: This entire neighborhood was pummeled by falling stars. How many people died here? The city rebuilt so fast… I…
speaker_akali: I can’t get them out of my head. It’s like I’m being haunted by their ghosts.
speaker_akali: I keep wondering if this is what being a guardian will always feel like. I really hope it isn’t.
speaker_akali: And now I think… I think something’s been following me.
	[Option 1] Following you? What does that mean?
	speaker_akali: At first, it was just bad dreams.
	speaker_akali: I kept seeing the mall collapse… that guardian vanishing into the light… Zoe, destroying everything…
	speaker_akali: But then… then there was a voice…
	[Option 2] Is it a monster? You’re pretty strong… Can’t you fight it?
	speaker_akali: I don’t even know what it is.
	speaker_akali: I thought I would stop having dreams of the invasion… but they never went away.
	speaker_akali: And now… I think the memories drew something to me. Something really, really bad.
	[Option 3] …Have you ever met a guy named Tedric?
	speaker_akali: Tedric?
	speaker_kaisa: Yeah, that guy who worked at the bakery. He’s been missing for a couple of weeks.
	speaker_akali: Really? That can’t be connected… right?
speaker_unknown: Akaaali…
speaker_kaisa: …Hm? What was that?
speaker_unknown: …YOu’ll… neVer…
speaker_kaisa: Akali, what?
speaker_akali: We… We need to go…
speaker_unknown: …SavE… mE…
speaker_kaisa: Sure, let’s… Hey… What’s happening to the streets?!
----------
speaker_akali: It’s here.
speaker_fiddlesticks: …SaaAAAvE MeeEEEeee!
----------
speaker_kaisa: What… What the hell is that…? Where are we?
speaker_akali: I… I don’t know..! Is that what’s been following me?!
speaker_akali: This fear...! Kai, I can’t transform…! I can’t focus!
speaker_fiddlesticks: Akali…
speaker_fiddlesticks: AKALI!!!!
speaker_kaisa: …Don’t worry. I’ve got you, Kali.
speaker_kaisa: I’ll protect you. I’ll protect you from everything.
speaker_kaisa: That’s what Star Guardians do.
speaker_kaisa: Hear that?! You’re not going near her! I won’t let you!
speaker_fiddlesticks: Erh… urp... all… Star... Guardians… must…
speaker_fiddlesticks: …falllllll…
speaker_kaisa: Huh? Is that it? Where’s it going?
speaker_kaisa: You running away? Afraid of the new guardians, huh?!
----------
speaker_unknown: Oh, I don’t think that’s the case at all, my sweet. You’re very lucky.
----------
speaker_unknown: Ah, much better. Your kind tends to prefer the shackles of an… ordered world, I believe? Can’t have all this bright purple mucking everything up.
speaker_unknown: Regardless. My friend is far more powerful than you realize. You and that blubbering sick pile wouldn’t have stood a chance.
speaker_kaisa: Don’t listen to her, okay?
speaker_akali: ...
speaker_unknown: You were able to transform despite the aura of fear? Very impressive.
speaker_unknown: I’ll have to keep an eye on you, won’t I? Hmhmhm.
speaker_kaisa: Tell me who you are before I blow you to pieces.
speaker_unknown: You? Oh, please. I was half expecting that monster to eat you both alive.
speaker_unknown: It’s an odd one, though. Seems to act almost randomly… and it certainly doesn't listen to anything I have to say.
speaker_unknown: But that makes the game more entertaining, doesn’t it? You guardians are slaves to a kind and just universe. Fiddlesticks is… free.
speaker_kaisa: Answer my question.
speaker_unknown: You’re making some very bold demands, my darling. But you can call me… Morgana.
speaker_morgana: Your instructor is a man named Puboe, correct? What say I pay him a visit? Relieve him of that pesky teaching position? I could use the pocket money, hmhmhm.
speaker_kaisa: Leave him alone! I won’t let you hurt him!
speaker_morgana: Ah, my darling girl. You think you can stop me?
speaker_morgana: Hmhmhm. You were right about needing that training. Would have helped you a year ago with Zoe’s little invasion.
speaker_kaisa: How do you know about that?! If you were involved somehow...!
speaker_morgana: Chin up, dearie. Your co-leader seems quite traumatized by this experience… You should focus on the present.
speaker_morgana: Especially when my terrifying friend is visiting each of your teammates right now!
	[Option 1] You’re lying.
	[Option 2] You better not touch my friends.
	[Option 3] That’s a smart outfit, but it won’t stop me from destroying you.
speaker_morgana: Oh, hush. Your friends are… well, mostly fine. Though they may be reevaluating their membership in the Star Guardians, hmhmhm.
speaker_morgana: And with that, toodaloo, little girl. I have places to go, and plans to further. We’ll meet again soon.
speaker_morgana: I’m sure your team will handle this wrinkle just fine! Hmhmhmhahahahaha!
speaker_kaisa: Hey! Hey, wait!
speaker_kaisa: …Akali, are you okay?
speaker_akali: …I’m sorry, Kai… I think I need to go home…
speaker_kaisa: Yeah.
speaker_kaisa: Yeah, me too. I hope everyone’s okay.
----------
Chapter 1 Act 3
----------
speaker_morgana: My, my. What a quaint little street.
speaker_morgana: They must have worked quickly to repair the damage after that brat botched her invasion last year. Hmph, what a waste.
speaker_morgana: And what did they replace all those buildings with, hm? Rows and rows of shops?
speaker_morgana: Hmhmhm! As ever, these humans bend themselves toward such casual cruelties. Wealth extraction! It seems so antithetical to the entire Star Guardian ideal.
speaker_morgana: But what do I know? I'm a soon-to-be lowly homeroom teacher at a… public school. [Shiver!]
speaker_morgana: Well, enough idling. I suppose it’s time to make a mess of things.
speaker_morgana: Gentlemen… the floor is yours.
----------
speaker_man: Hey… what’s that…?
speaker_woman: N... no way! It’s a bunch of monsters!
speaker_man: Stay back! S… stop! Someone help!
speaker_morgana: Here’s your first test, guardians. Let’s hope you pass.
----------
speaker_ekko: Akali! Keep your head in the game! This is what guardians do!
speaker_akali: Those are actual monsters! I don’t… I can’t focus… because of that stupid Fiddlesticks thing, ugh!
speaker_man: P-please! Don’t hurt me! Waaaaagh!
speaker_woman: Where are the Star Guardians?! Where is Lux?! Help us!
speaker_ekko: Ugh. Lux isn’t here anymore. Wish she was, but…
speaker_ekko: Shoot. There are way too many of those things. People are going to get hurt.
speaker_ekko: You ready to put it all on the line, ‘Kali? We might not come back alive.
speaker_akali: A…alive?! What do you mean? You think we might die out there?!
speaker_ekko: Hey, maybe! But we’re Star Guardians!
speaker_ekko: Or at least we’re supposed to be.
speaker_akali: Why is everyone obsessed about what a Star Guardian is supposed to be? Are Star Guardians supposed to be killed by monsters?!
speaker_akali: I just didn’t think… Ugh, this reminds me of last year… I don’t…
speaker_kaisa: Akali! Ekko!
speaker_akali: Kai! You’re here!
speaker_akali: I’m so gl—
	[Option 1] What’s the situation?
	speaker_ekko: Monsters, tons of them. They’re kinda puny by themselves, but there are at least a few dozen out there.
	speaker_akali: We don’t know where they came from. And everything’s all… messed up… like when that creepy monster attacked us.
	speaker_kaisa: I was wondering about that. The pattern looks familiar… What was that creature’s name? Fiddlesticks?
	speaker_ekko: Ugh, I don’t wanna think about that thing. It showed up in my dreams… I’ll never forget that voice…
	[Option 2] I’m taking point. Everyone, follow my lead.
	speaker_ekko: Copy that, Cap’n Kai. What’s the big plan?
	speaker_kaisa: Hm. Looks like a few dozen of them, and they’re coming out of that checkerboard goop.
	speaker_kaisa: Sweep the street. We hit fast and hard, and close that breach.
	speaker_ekko: Got it. What do we do if that Fiddlesticks thing shows up?
	speaker_akali: Ugh… Do you think it will?
	[Option 3] Loving the checkerboard nightmare aesthetic. We should come here more often.
	speaker_ekko: Not the time, Kai’Sa!
	speaker_kaisa: Heh. You said “time.”
	speaker_akali: Pfft. You did.
	speaker_ekko: Yeah, yeah, very funny. That pattern on the street looks a lot like Fiddlesticks, so if we run into it, maybe it’ll share your sense of humor.
	speaker_akali: [Ulp...!]
speaker_kaisa: I’m not feeling that overwhelming sense of dread… It must not be here.
speaker_akali: Whew… that’s a relief.
speaker_kaisa: I sense that woman, though… She was here. Morgana.
speaker_kaisa: Kali? Are you good? We need you for this, okay?
speaker_akali: …I-I don’t… I don’t want…
speaker_akali: Hm! Yeah, I’ll be fine. The mission comes first.
speaker_kaisa: Glad you’re with us, then. And don’t worry… I’ll keep you safe.
speaker_akali: Pfft… Yeah… I know you will. You’re a Star Guardian. It’s what you do!
speaker_ekko: Oh, my God. Fight now! Talk later!
speaker_akali: Whatever, boy genius. Let’s see what you’ve got out there.
speaker_kaisa: I have Sona and Taliyah covering both ends of the street, so nothing is getting in or out.
speaker_kaisa: Check your angles, and prioritize saving anyone in danger. We’re going in!
speaker_akali: It’s the big show, everyone! Get ready to make a statement!
speaker_ekko: Excuse me, but I’m Ekko.
speaker_ekko: I always make a statement.
----------
speaker_kaisa: We’re not just guardians in training anymore! Let’s show this city we’re real heroes!
----------
speaker_ekko: Welcome to VC! Now, get out!
----------
speaker_akali: Cut through everything! Don’t let these chumps touch you!
----------
speaker_akali: Ha… ha… Okay, maybe that wasn’t as bad as I...
speaker_akali: …Wait, did we do it?
----------
speaker_ekko: I think so? I don’t see any more monsters.
speaker_kaisa: And all that stuff that was warping the street is gone. I hesitate to say it, but…
	[Option 1] I think we might have won?
	[Option 2] We saved the city! WE SAVED THE CITY!
	[Option 3] Pentakill! Ace! Legendary!
speaker_sona: …!
speaker_chiizu: OUR FIRST REAL VICTORY! …Is what Miss Sona said. Right, Miss Sona?
speaker_taliyah: That was crazy! I was over there, like, fwoom! And then Sona was, like, bwong! And you guys were, like, boooom! It was awesome!
speaker_taliyah: Semi-related, but there is a huge magical wall blocking the end of the street that I may have put there and cannot remove. We should go.
speaker_akali: You’re never this amped at school, Tali.
speaker_taliyah: Because I don’t have star powers or a cool outfit there, duh. Also, I smashed this monster with a huge rock, and it was like, “Bleeeurgh”.
speaker_kaisa: …Thanks, everyone. Let’s get out of here before people start to notice what we look like.
speaker_ekko: Aw, come on. I wanna be a bootleg action figure like Rakan or that blonde dude… Ezmorp? You know, the blue one.
speaker_sona: ...
speaker_chiizu: Speech, speech!
speaker_kaisa: We can save it for a victory meal tomorrow, alright?
speaker_akali: Boooooo! We want a speech, or to be bootleg Star Guardian action figures with weird names!
speaker_kaisa: If we leave now, I’ll do the speech tomorrow at Noodle Bill’s.
speaker_akali: Noodle Bill’s?! Everyone go home! We’re done here!
speaker_ekko: Wow, she moves fast.
speaker_kaisa: Lady likes her noodles.
speaker_kaisa: One thing I need to ask, though… Did it feel like this was a test? Those things went down… almost too easily.
----------
speaker_ekko: Hey, why overthink it?
speaker_sona: ...
speaker_chiizu: Let’s just bask in our very first victory!
speaker_sona: ...!
speaker_chiizu: WHAT DID I SAY WRONG?! WAS IT BASK?! I HAVE A VERY LARGE VOCABULARY!
speaker_taliyah: Heh. But, yeah… makes you wonder…
speaker_taliyah: Who else might be watching us?
----------
Chapter 2 Act 1
----------
speaker_kaisa: Tell me, what would you do?
speaker_kaisa: You saved the world, right? I saw you do it. Come on, tell me something!
speaker_kaisa: Lux… Please… What should I do?
----------
speaker_kaisa: Ugh… I’m talking to a statue. And to myself.
speaker_kaisa: [Sigh]
speaker_kaisa: It felt like we were finally safe, like you made everything… safe. That’s why I wanted to be like you. But…
----------
speaker_morgana: Hello, class. I come bearing some truly tragic news.
speaker_morgana: Your former instructor… Mr. Puboe? He’s met with a very unfortunate accident during the shocking incident downtown. I’m afraid he won’t be returning.
speaker_morgana: Thankfully, I was willing to step in to help shape your young minds. Though I’m new to the profession, I’m sure we’ll all learn to see eye to eye.
speaker_morgana: Some of us… more than others, I suspect. Hmhmhm.
speaker_morgana: Despite the circumstances… I think we’re going to have a wonderful year together.
----------
speaker_kaisa: We can’t transform at school. We can’t reveal our identities…
speaker_kaisa: We can’t do anything! How do you fight a monster that’s hiding in plain sight?! I just want to protect everyone!
speaker_kaisa: This city looks up to you. They remember the old guardians. I want to… No, I have to be a Star Guardian the way you were. A leader.
speaker_kaisa: Lux… Tell me… What do I do?
speaker_akali: Talking to the statue again, huh?
speaker_kaisa: Akali! I, uh...
	[Option 1] Yeah, you caught me.
	speaker_akali: You know… I’m around if you want to talk.
	speaker_kaisa: I… I don’t want you to hear this stuff. These thoughts stay with me.
	speaker_akali: We weren’t always Star Guardians, Kai… We were friends first.
	speaker_kaisa: Akali… I…
	[Option 2] Uh… no?
	speaker_akali: It’s alright, Kai. I’m not going to make fun of you or anything.
	speaker_akali: You know, you don't have to talk to a statue. I’m always here if you need me.
	speaker_kaisa: …Thanks, Kali. You know I don’t like asking for help. If I focus on leading the group…
	speaker_akali: Well, don’t forget I’m here, okay? I’m not a statue, but you know.
	[Option 3] Excuse me, I’m with my therapist.
	speaker_akali: Oho, look at you! So fancy with your big-city therapist!
	speaker_kaisa: You also live in the city!
	speaker_akali: True, but if I needed to talk about my problems on a budget, maybe I’d go to… I dunno… my best friend?
	speaker_kaisa: Akali, we’ve talked about this. Leading the guardians is…
speaker_kaisa: Hm? That’s weird… My phone’s going off.
speaker_akali: Why’s that weird? Ekko is always texting about machine stuff. Or maybe Taliyah “found another rock”.
speaker_akali: Or… oof, I hope it’s not a giant wall of text from Sona. I love her, but… please… my one brain cell…
speaker_kaisa: [“Nice work handling those creatures. Now that we know you can handle yourselves, we should discuss a… mutual problem. Meet us outside the city, alone.”]
speaker_kaisa: [“And don’t keep us waiting! You know how I get when I’m BORED!”]
speaker_kaisa: [Hm… Must be that monster again… Fiddlesticks. I won’t let it hurt Akali, or the team.]
speaker_akali: Kai? You’re getting quiet again.
speaker_akali: It’s a Sona text, isn’t it? How long? Two paragraphs?
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_kaisa: I’m so sorry, but I have to go. This is…
speaker_kaisa: …I just have to go.
speaker_akali: Wait, what’s wrong?! Kai?! Kai!
speaker_akali: Hmph. Think you can avoid me? Best-friend-following ninja-jutsu, activate!
speaker_akali: ...
speaker_akali: Don’t judge me, Lux statue. I’m leaning into it.
----------
speaker_kaisa: Huff… huff…
speaker_kaisa: …Guh… Alright… huff… This is the spot.
speaker_kaisa: …At least, I think it is. Exact coordinates would have been nice.
speaker_kaisa: …Huff… ugh… Flying is… so much easier…
speaker_unknown: I concur. It’s one of our more useful powers.
speaker_kaisa: …Huh?
speaker_kaisa: Show yourself, monster! I’m not in the mood for games!
speaker_unknown: Tee-hee! She thinks WE’RE the monster! That’s a fun game. I wanna play THAT one!
speaker_unknown: This isn’t another chance for you to destroy the city. You know what we’re here for.
speaker_unknown: Oh, BOO! I just want to have FUN!
speaker_kaisa: No way… That’s impossible…
speaker_unknown: Oh, it’s VERY possible!
----------
speaker_syndra: Don’t act so surprised. This is not the first time we’ve met.
speaker_zoe: Oh, boy! A widdle baby STAR GUARDIAN! Can I peel off her skin? CAN I?!
speaker_zoe: OooooOOOooooo, wait! She recognizes me! Was it something I did? Was it someone I KILLED?!
speaker_syndra: Silence. You’ve spoken enough, Twilight Star. Empty threats accomplish nothing… and we don’t have much time.
----------
speaker_kaisa: Wh… what are you two doing together?! Syndra, you’re a Star Guardian! And that’s...!
speaker_syndra: …Also a Star Guardian.
speaker_syndra: Or at least, she was one. Though that was many lifetimes ago.
speaker_zoe: Now, I have lots of fun DISINTEGRATING my friends! That’s YOU, widdle guardian!
speaker_kaisa: No… I saw Rakan destroy you! The guardians beat you!
speaker_kaisa: The entire city watched you die!
speaker_zoe: Awww, are your expectations crushed? Do you need a hug and some sparkles to get over it? Well, TOO BAD!
speaker_zoe: You can’t kill chaos, silly! But that Rakan boy really did put the hurt on me, YEOWCH!
speaker_zoe: It took me AGES to find this world again! And by then, all the guardians I wanted to kill were loooong gone!
speaker_zoe: …Except for this one. Yuck.
speaker_syndra: The feeling is mutual.
	[Option 1] Wait, so why are you both here?
	speaker_syndra: As I mentioned, we have a mutual problem.
	speaker_kaisa: ...Morgana.
	speaker_syndra: Morgana? Interesting… So, she’s already here…
	speaker_zoe: Ooooh, one of your stupid new playmates, Syndra?
	speaker_syndra: In a certain light. Though I’ve never been very fond of her. Deal with Morgana as you will, young guardian. She is not why we’ve contacted you.
	[Option 2] Syndra, how could you betray the Star Guardians like this?
	speaker_zoe: Ohohoho! Syndra, how COULD you!? The guardians! The First Star! Friendship and love and cookies!
	speaker_syndra: …Ah. I see.
	speaker_syndra: You are pursuing an ideal you don’t fully understand, girl. Do you think Lux was the first to take the oath? Or Ahri? Or Xayah?
	speaker_syndra: The First Star’s power comes at a terrible cost. In the end, it takes the only thing that matters… and that is why we’re here.
	speaker_zoe: Looks like we’re gonna be PALS, widdle baby guardian!
	[Option 3] Zoe, I’ll never forgive you for what you’ve done!
	speaker_syndra: That’s right… You witnessed the invasion.
	speaker_kaisa: The Battle of the Twilight Star… So many people… my friends…
	speaker_zoe: Uh-oh! Do we have some UNEXAMINED TRAUMA on our hands?! Oooh, I LOVE trauma!
	speaker_zoe: Did they SCREAM when they died… or were they lucky enough to get BOPPED on the head by a falling star?!
	speaker_zoe: …YOU won’t forgive ME?! You don’t know ANYTHING! You humans live for a hundred years, and then, you’re GONE! You can’t imagine...! You can’t!
speaker_syndra: We’ve come for Fiddlesticks.
speaker_kaisa: …The checkerboard monster with the awful voice? That’s who you want?
speaker_zoe: It was CHESS! SHE LOVED CHESS!
speaker_syndra: Zoe!
speaker_zoe: She… she loved…
speaker_syndra: ...
speaker_syndra: Fiddlesticks is more powerful than any foe I have ever faced. It has existed since the days of the very first Star Guardians… and has hunted us all from the shadows.
speaker_kaisa: Since the first...?
speaker_syndra: Zoe, myself, and our companions. The original Star Guardians chosen by the First Star. Back before the costs of our oaths were made clear.
speaker_zoe: We’re gonna SMASH that monster for what it did! I’M GONNA RIP OFF ITS STUPID HEAD!
speaker_syndra: It has grown far too powerful with victims and time. While we are strong, we cannot stop it alone.
speaker_syndra: Prepare yourself and your team. If we strike together, maybe we stand a chance.
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_kaisa: …Ugh.
speaker_kaisa: …Alright. I’ll get them ready.
speaker_kaisa: But what happens after this? What about… her?
speaker_zoe: HMPH! It’s rude to point!
speaker_syndra: We’ll cross that bridge if we survive. Until then…
speaker_syndra: …Take care, guardian. The battle ahead may be our last.

speaker_akali: K… Kai? Kai’Sa?

Chapter 2 Act 2
----------
speaker_kaisa: Kali! Hey! Stop walking so fast!
speaker_kaisa: I can explain! Would you just listen to me for a minute?!
speaker_kaisa: Akali!!!
----------
speaker_kaisa: Please! I didn’t have a choice!
speaker_akali: You didn’t have a choice?
speaker_akali: It’s bad enough to have Morgana standing in front of the class every day, but you…
speaker_akali: You want me to work with Zoe? Do you not remember what she did?!
speaker_kaisa: Of course, I remember! I was there during the invasion! I saw what happened!
speaker_akali: I don’t know what you saw. Obviously something different from what I saw.
speaker_akali: I watched a paddle star destroy my old neighborhood. A building collapsed next to me with people still inside. I saw a Star Guardian actually die.
speaker_akali: You saw… what? Lux saving the day? Being a big hero, getting a statue? They left us, Kai’Sa.
speaker_akali: The old guardians are all gone. All of them! They left us here to do this ourselves, and now, I…
speaker_akali: I am being hunted and tortured by that… that thing. I can’t even go home at night by myself. I hear it everywhere. It’s following me!
speaker_kaisa: Akali, I can fix this. The guardians aren’t gone! Syndra said—
speaker_akali: Stop. Don’t even say her name. As a matter of fact, don’t even say my name. Don’t talk to me, period.
speaker_akali: Your obsession with being a Star Guardian is… I can’t deal with it anymore. Do you even care how I feel? Do you know what I see when I close my eyes?!
speaker_akali: So many people I cared about are dead. And now there’s nothing stopping me from dying, too. And you don’t even care.
speaker_akali: I took this stupid oath because I believed in you! You promised nothing would change!
speaker_akali: ...
speaker_akali: I need you to tell me we’re going to win this... that everything will be fine.
speaker_akali: And I need you to mean it.
	[Option 1] Everything will be fine. [LIE]
	speaker_akali: Ha!
	speaker_akali: I’ll be there the next time there’s a monster attack. But you and I? Nah.
	speaker_akali: I don’t want to hear from you unless it’s a life-or-death situation. “Best friends.” Pfft.
	speaker_akali: Just stay away from me.
	[Option 2] Everything will be fine. [TRUTH]
	speaker_akali: Heh. You’re that confident?
	speaker_akali: You know, I tried to follow you. When you went to talk to that creepy-eyed little murderer.
	speaker_akali: Guess what happened? I was attacked by Fiddlesticks. Again! And you didn’t even notice.
	speaker_akali: It’s happening almost every day. I can hear it in my room at night. But, oh, you have to be a leader. You have to “be a Star Guardian.”
	[Option 3] I don’t have an answer for you.
	speaker_akali: Yeah, you don’t.
	speaker_akali: Let me make things clear for you right now, since you’re the big leader of the Star Guardians.
	speaker_akali: A woman from nowhere is teaching homeroom in our grade, and sometimes, she decides to summon hundreds of monsters to attack people in the streets.
	speaker_akali: I am being hunted… like an animal… by… I don’t even know how to describe it. But I’m pretty sure it’s going to kill me.
	speaker_akali: And now, you're gonna make us team up with Zoe—the source of all our nightmares, the reason this all happened!
speaker_kaisa: …I’m just trying to protect everyone.
speaker_akali: Oh, really? Did you tell Sona about Zoe? She sure does love loud noises and crowds after being traumatized by explosions!
speaker_akali: What about Taliyah, who’s so confident at school? Or maybe Ekko? Our friend obsessed with literally changing the past?
speaker_kaisa: They… Yeah, they weren’t happy.
speaker_akali: Wow. Shocker. Kai’Sa the leader didn’t check in beforehand.
speaker_akali: We’re done here. I’m sure Fiddlesticks will be a delightful walking companion, whenever and wherever it decides to tell me that I’m going to die.
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_kaisa: Ugh.
speaker_kaisa: I just… I want to protect you all like Lux did…
speaker_kaisa: Why can’t I protect you...?
----------
speaker_noodle_bill: Well, well! If it isn’t Miss Kai’Sa herself! Welcome back to Noodle Bill’s!
speaker_noodle_bill: Can I treat you to the usual, or...?
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_noodle_bill: Let me whip something up for you. On the house.
speaker_noodle_bill: Until then, take a load off! Relax a little. You can eat with your friend.
speaker_kaisa: …My friend?
speaker_syndra: Hello, young guardian.
speaker_kaisa: Syndra?! But… you’re… you!? And in your uniform?! What about… but… your identity?!
speaker_syndra: Heh. I suppose it’s a bit surprising to see me here.
speaker_syndra: But, as the saying goes… “everyone loves Noodle Bill’s.”
speaker_syndra: Don’t worry about him, by the way. The man can keep a secret.
speaker_noodle_bill: Your friends show up here in uniform all the time. Benefit of being open late—lots of Star Guardian regulars, and they show up very hungry.
speaker_kaisa: [Ugh… Akali...! Or Ekko? Maybe Taliyah…]
speaker_noodle_bill: It’s all of them. And you, twice.
speaker_kaisa: M…me?! TWICE?! I don’t even—!
speaker_noodle_bill: Don’t be too hard on yourself. Syndra’s friends were even worse.
speaker_noodle_bill: In fact, I seem to remember…
speaker_syndra: Bill, please, not another one of your stories.
speaker_noodle_bill: What was the bird girl’s name... Xayah! Boy, she used to show up at the strangest hours, and always with that Rakan…
speaker_syndra: Ugh. Those two. By the time I met them, they were… different… but still, so much PDA…
speaker_kaisa: So… So you...?
speaker_noodle_bill: I’ve been serving Star Guardians a long, long time. Don’t worry. Your identity is safe with me.
speaker_syndra: And for that, we thank you.
speaker_kaisa: Huh… I guess I assumed the old Star Guardians were always saving the day from evil… I didn’t really consider they had another side to them.
speaker_syndra: Ha!
speaker_syndra: More like saving the day from Jinx’s little temper tantrums. Or Sarah refusing to talk to anyone or show up for anything.
speaker_syndra: We weren’t that different, Kai’Sa. Most of the group was still in high school… like you and your friends.
speaker_syndra: We had fights, there were falling-outs, people made up. Usually crying. Sometimes ugly crying, with snot.
speaker_syndra: Everyone was constantly embroiled in drama, and there was always some new, horrible monster to fight.
speaker_syndra: It was… nice. Reminded me of… well, my first team. Zoe’s team.
speaker_kaisa: Oh, yeah… You mentioned that before. Huh, you and Zoe.
speaker_kaisa: Now that you’ve brought it up, I have to ask…
	[Option 1] What happened to your old team?
	speaker_syndra: My old team…
	speaker_syndra: Gwen, Akshan, Zoe, myself… and Harp. Most are gone now. Fallen. The ultimate fate of all guardians.
	speaker_kaisa: Fallen?
	speaker_syndra: Sadly, yes. They were kind, gentle souls… Even Zoe, if you can imagine it. Even Akshan, who hated putting on his shirt for some reason.
	[Option 2] Why did Zoe attack the city?
	speaker_syndra: Hm. It might be difficult to understand, but… she found a loophole in the oath.
	speaker_syndra: “Star Guardians burn bright, but all are fated to fall.” We’re killed in battle, or lost… or worse. It’s the price of doing good.
	speaker_kaisa: Wait, so she thought she was… helping people?
	speaker_syndra: By killing and resurrecting guardians, Zoe voided the contract with the First Star. She… believed she was saving them. Though… There were unintended consequences.
	[Option 3] Did you two have a falling-out?
	speaker_syndra: …Yes.
	speaker_syndra: Something… happened… to one of our companions. Something we didn’t know was possible. Though, in hindsight, it should have been obvious.
	speaker_syndra: They fell. Zoe couldn’t handle it. She vanished… only to return, twisted and deranged. And then… she… our team…
	speaker_syndra: …I’m sorry. It happened so long ago, but it’s difficult to talk about.
speaker_noodle_bill: Ramen’s ready, Miss Kai’Sa. I gave you extra fish cakes, just the way you like it.
speaker_kaisa: Oh, wow...! This aroma...!
speaker_noodle_bill: That’s the “Star Guardians having a personal problem” special. I came up with it, oh, three teams ago? Four? I’m old... Who can remember?
speaker_kaisa: Four teams ago?! How many times have you served this?!
speaker_noodle_bill: Ha! Who knows? Anyway, enjoy.
	[Option 1] I’m going to eat this with the fury of one thousand feudal warlords.
	[Option 2] Star Guardian noodles, huh? Alright, let's dig in!
	[Option 3] Thanks, Bill. It was nice talking to you again.
speaker_noodle_bill: Rock on.
speaker_syndra: The point is, Kai’Sa, that every team has problems. Some are just part of life, but others…
speaker_syndra: ...
speaker_syndra: Zoe and I… We had the chance to save our teammate from Fiddlesticks. But we didn’t. And in the end, that failure destroyed us.
speaker_kaisa: So that’s why you’re really here…
speaker_syndra: Correct. In a way… it’s to put our friends to rest. Something we should have done long ago.
speaker_syndra: Don’t make the same mistakes we did. Not if you don’t have to.
speaker_kaisa: Syndra...
speaker_syndra: Ah, but it’s late. I should be going.
speaker_syndra: I will see you when the creature surfaces, little guardian. I hope you are prepared for the fight to come.
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_kaisa: Star Guardians are meant to fall, huh…?
----------
speaker_kaisa: Akali… No. I won’t let you.

Chapter 2 Act 3
----------
speaker_fiddlesticks: …Kai’Sa… Help me…
speaker_fiddlesticks: …DON’T… LEAVE ME…
----------
speaker_fiddlesticks: Hhhhaaaaahhhhh… Star… Guardians…
speaker_syndra: Hmph. Found you.
speaker_zoe: Wahhh, it’s a big scary monster! Oh no! What will I doooo?
speaker_zoe: OH, I REMEMBER NOW!
speaker_zoe: I’M A MONSTER, TOO! MYAHAHAHA!
speaker_syndra: Well, well. The power of chaos… The Twilight Star. I haven’t seen this sort of display in a while.
speaker_zoe: ISN’T IT FUN!? I’M GONNA PAINT THE WALLS WITH THAT THING’S FACE!
speaker_zoe: GO AHEAD, SYNDRA! THIS MONSTER KILLED HARP! TAKE OFF THE EYE PATCH AND REALLY LET LOOSE!
speaker_syndra: Heh. Tempting.
speaker_syndra: Let’s see if our new friends show up, first.
speaker_zoe: OH, BOO! BREAK OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE! MYAHAHA!
speaker_syndra: Only if I have to. You know what will happen when I do.
speaker_zoe: KNOW?! SYNDRA, I’M COUNTING ON IT!
----------
speaker_kaisa: Alright, is everyone here?
speaker_ekko: I’m here, but I want it on the record that I don’t like this.
speaker_taliyah: Seconded. This sucks, Kai’Sa.
speaker_sona: [“I third this.”]
speaker_ekko: Sona thirds this.
speaker_sona: [“She can read sign language, Ekko.”]
speaker_ekko: I don’t know that! Where’s the annoying rat thing that’s always yelling?
speaker_chiizu: Sob, sob… tossed aside! Left behind! Traded in like an old piece of cheese!
speaker_chiizu: It’s hard to paint such vivid pictures with words...! Oh, my artist’s pride...!
speaker_kaisa: Hey! Focus up! This is serious!
speaker_kaisa: I know you’re all upset with me, but Fiddlesticks is a huge threat to the city, and a bigger threat to us.
speaker_kaisa: This might be our only chance to stop it… even if we have to team up with someone like Zoe.
speaker_kaisa: …Hey, where’s Akali?
speaker_akali: …I’m here.
speaker_kaisa: Oh! Good. That’s… I’m glad you’re okay.
speaker_kaisa: Akali… I… uh…
	[Option 1] We’re going to save you. I promise.
	speaker_akali: Yeah. Whatever. Let’s just kill this thing and get out of here.
	[Option 2] Star Guardians stick together. You’re one of us.
	speaker_akali: Yeah. Whatever. Let’s just kill this thing and get out of here.
	[Option 3] It’s a dumb checkerboard thing, and we’re going to kick its checkerbutt.
	speaker_akali: ...
	speaker_akali: …Heh.
speaker_akali: Well, meet you out there.
speaker_taliyah: …Has Akali been getting enough sleep? She looks exhausted.
speaker_sona: [“Something’s not right. Kai’Sa, what’s been going on?”]
speaker_kaisa: …Fiddlesticks has been hunting Akali. I don’t know for how long.
speaker_kaisa: But if we don’t stop it here… eventually, it’s going to kill her.
speaker_kaisa: I… I didn’t stop it when I could have. And I didn’t tell any of you… I just… I thought I could fix it…
speaker_ekko: Hey.
speaker_ekko: We’ll stop it. Here. Today.
speaker_taliyah: Yeah! This is the biggest monster we’ve fought so far! And I’m still pumped up from last time!
speaker_taliyah: Round two, baby! I’m gonna punch its head!
speaker_sona: [“We can talk it out later. For now, we fight.”]
speaker_kaisa: Everyone… I…
speaker_kaisa: Thank you. Let’s clean house.
----------
speaker_kaisa: Wait… What’s happening?
speaker_fiddlesticks: …YesSSS… AlllLLL GUARdiaNSS… FaLLlll…
speaker_syndra: Get back!
speaker_syndra: We’re on its home turf now. It’s at the height of its power here.
speaker_syndra: Fiddlesticks is more than any one of us can handle alone. We’ll need to attack together, or nobody’s leaving this place alive.
speaker_zoe: SO NICE OF YOU TO JOIN US, WIDDLE STAR GUARDIAN! EVER SEEN A CHAOS DIMENSION BEFORE!?
speaker_zoe: AS FAR AS THEY GO, THIS ONE’S NOT BAD! SHAME I HAVE TO RIP IT APART! MYAHAHA!
speaker_sona: [“That’s her!”]
speaker_ekko: No way… We have to fight alongside the Twilight Star…
speaker_taliyah: I… I’ll do it! I’m not backing down!
speaker_kaisa: Don’t worry, guardians. Remember, she’s on our side this time.
speaker_kaisa: Akali, are you with me?
speaker_akali: …I’ll take the rear. I was able to hide from this thing in the shadows. Might help take it off guard.
speaker_akali: Not being seen suits me anyway.
speaker_ekko: I’ll go with her. Just in case.
speaker_kaisa: Alright, Ekko. Be careful. Everyone else, follow Syndra and Zoe! We fight together!
speaker_syndra: …Heh. Brings back memories, doesn’t it?
speaker_zoe: GYAHAHAHAHA! CHAOS REIGNS!!!
speaker_syndra: ...Or not.
speaker_fiddlesticks: FEAR… THE… DARK...!
speaker_syndra: The dark, huh? Poor choice of words!
speaker_zoe: YOU’LL PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID TO HARP! FEED THE FLAME OF CHAOS!
speaker_taliyah: I don’t have the flame of chaos or whatever, but I’m plenty strong enough to deal with this chess freak!
speaker_sona: [“You made a big mistake hurting my friend. Now, it’s personal.”]
speaker_kaisa: I won’t let you take Akali! I won’t let you hurt anyone ever again!
speaker_kaisa: Guardians, attack!
speaker_narrator: ...
speaker_narrator: ...
speaker_narrator: ...
speaker_fiddlesticks: …Urp… urp… aHHhH…
speaker_kaisa: Ugh… It’s too strong! We didn’t even make a dent!
----------
speaker_akali: Kai’Sa. That cage in the center has a familiar trapped inside. I think that’s the weak point.
speaker_kaisa: A familiar…? Right! Once more, everyone! This time, aim for the cage!
speaker_narrator: !!!
----------
speaker_narrator: ...
----------
speaker_akali: An enemy… has been slain.
speaker_akali: Always wanted to say that. Not as cool as I hoped.
speaker_kaisa: Is it… Is it finally over…?
speaker_akali: I think so… hey, what’s that? Are you seeing that?
speaker_kaisa: Is it… a girl?
----------
speaker_zoe: H… Harp...?
speaker_zoe: HARP?!
speaker_harp: Zoe… It’s so good to see you again.
speaker_harp: And you brought Syndra, too? What a reunion… I wish Gwen and Akshan could be here for this…
speaker_harp: Seems like I’ve made a real mess of everything… Guess we should have paid more attention to those oaths…
----------
speaker_narrator: ...
----------
speaker_akali: …No way.
speaker_kaisa: Syndra, what’s going on? Is that… your old teammate?
speaker_syndra: The fate of every guardian is to fall, Kai’Sa.
speaker_syndra: Harp was the first, ever. She burned so brightly… brighter than anyone in the universe… but the First Star had tricked us, and soon enough, she burned away.
speaker_syndra: We couldn’t forgive ourselves after we saw what she became. An undying monster, drawn to guardians on the edge of darkness.
speaker_akali: ...
----------
speaker_narrator: ...
----------
speaker_zoe: Harp! I’m sorry! I’m sorry-I’m sorry-I’m sorry!
speaker_zoe: I tried to save all the guardians I could! I had to kill them! I couldn’t let anyone fall again!
speaker_zoe: Harp… P-please! I was helping! You have to believe me...!
speaker_harp: Zoe… my best friend… I’m the one who’s sorry. I thought I could keep going… but… I miscalculated… What a novice move…
speaker_harp: I… forgive you… Zoe…
speaker_zoe: No! NO! I WON’T LET YOU GO!
speaker_zoe: I’LL KILL EVERYONE! I’LL DESTROY EVERYTHING! YOU CAN’T LEAVE ME ALL ALONE AGAIN!
----------
speaker_harp: Ha… ha… It’s okay… Zoe…
speaker_harp: I will always… be your best friend… no… matter… what…
----------
speaker_narrator: ...
----------
speaker_kaisa: Huh? Where’d everybody go?
speaker_akali: Ekko? Sona? Tali? H-hello?
speaker_zoe: …They’re fine. In your stupid city, probably.
speaker_syndra: ...
speaker_syndra: Zoe, I…
speaker_zoe: Shut up and listen to what I have to say. I’m leaving. For now, anyway.
speaker_zoe: I don’t know when, but I’ll be back. And when that happens… we’re going to be enemies. You, and me, and all of them, too. I’ll kill every last one of you.
speaker_zoe: But for now…
speaker_zoe: Ugh… Thanks.
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_akali: ...
speaker_syndra: All those years… Time really does fly, doesn’t it?
speaker_syndra: [Hm. Myself, Zoe, Morgana, and Fiddlesticks, all in the same place… With so many powerful opponents, she won’t be able to resist the challenge.]
speaker_syndra: Kai’Sa. I am also leaving.
speaker_kaisa: Wait, why? You could join us! We could protect the world together!
speaker_syndra: You’ll be fine. A powerful Outer Guardian is already on her way.
speaker_syndra: Putting Harp to rest was… the last thing I needed to do here. I am done now. My time as a hero has ended.
speaker_akali: Hey… What are you talking about...? You protected the city from Zoe! There are plushies of you! I own, like, three!
speaker_syndra: I understand your confusion, but I am part of a darker story. A… star in another sky. And it is well past time that I returned.
speaker_syndra: We will also meet again, young guardians. Pray it is not soon.
speaker_kaisa: What’s that supposed to mean? What aren’t you telling us?
speaker_kaisa: Syndra! SYNDRA!
----------
speaker_syndra: ...
----------
speaker_syndra: The stars are finally out, guardians… Don’t worry, my old friend will treat you well.
speaker_syndra: Train them to be strong, Nilah. They will need it for the trials to come.

Akali Act 1
----------
speaker_akali: Mrph… gulp… urp… so good.
speaker_kaisa: Slow down, Akali. Those noodles aren’t going anywhere.
speaker_akali: Mrnch… ulp… Yeah they are. Into my… mrmph…. mouth.
speaker_kaisa: You’re gonna get a stomachache. And we have training later—
speaker_akali: And the award for best impression of my dad goes to…
speaker_kaisa: I’m just trying to help.
speaker_akali: Mrmph… slurp…. You know how you can help me?
speaker_kaisa: Ugh, watching this is so gross. How?
speaker_akali: Order me a refill. I’m running low.
speaker_noodle_bill: Nobody runs low on my watch.
speaker_akali: Thanks, Bill!
speaker_akali: See, someone knows when they’re wanted.
speaker_noodle_bill: ...
speaker_akali: Mmrmph… slurp… mrnchh… Uh… Bill? Are you still there?
speaker_noodle_bill: Yeah.
speaker_akali: ...
speaker_noodle_bill: I couldn’t help but overhear…
speaker_akali: Oh, c’mon! Not you, too!
speaker_noodle_bill: It’s okay. I’m not here to talk about you. I’ve got problems of my own.
speaker_noodle_bill: I’m sure it doesn’t compare to your little high-school adventures…
speaker_noodle_bill: But for me? This day was pretty memorable.
speaker_akali: Are you going to tell the story, or can I finish eating this like a monster?
speaker_kaisa: Ssshh!
----------
speaker_noodle_bill: Every morning, I wake up early to make my broth.
speaker_noodle_bill: I like to read the paper while I let the flavors mix… But today, I felt like taking a walk.
----------
speaker_akali: Fascinating stuff, Bill.
speaker_kaisa: Akali!
----------
speaker_noodle_bill: Valoran City is peaceful in the early hours of the day. A special sort of quiet.
speaker_noodle_bill: I was enraptured by the smells of fresh bread warming in the oven…
speaker_noodle_bill: Of the light reflecting off tiny droplets of dew on freshly cut grass…
speaker_noodle_bill: Before I knew it, I had spent hours walking through our city, and I found myself in a place that I didn’t recognize…
speaker_noodle_bill: “Oh, no!” I thought. “I must get back to my broth! If it reaches a boil, my hard work—and the day’s profits—will be lost.”
speaker_noodle_bill: But I had been so swept up by beauty on my stroll, that I had not traced my steps. I rushed through the streets, and by sheer luck, I found my way back to my stand.
speaker_noodle_bill: My broth still simmered lightly. All was well.
----------
speaker_kaisa: Oh. That was… evocative.
speaker_akali: Don’t lie to the man, Kai! Bill, what are you even saying? That was your most boring story yet!
speaker_noodle_bill: Gah hah! I appreciate your feedback, Akali.
speaker_noodle_bill: But I think perhaps you both missed the moral of my tale.
speaker_kaisa: Tell better stories?
speaker_akali: Learn how to use GPS?
speaker_noodle_bill: Trust in your friends.
speaker_kaisa: I’m… not sure I understand.
speaker_akali: Isn’t it obvious, Kai’sa? Bill is saying the pork broth is his friend.
speaker_kaisa: No, he’s not…
speaker_kaisa: Wait—are you?
speaker_noodle_bill: Not quite. But friendship is like a good broth.
speaker_noodle_bill: You put in time. And effort. That’s the chicken feet. And love. The pig bones.
speaker_noodle_bill: And you must know that even when you aren’t there… the friendship will simmer on.
speaker_kaisa: Love is like… boiling pig bones?
speaker_akali: Well said, noodle man. Very wise. Love the part about the feet and bones.
speaker_kaisa: You weren’t even listening. You were about to doze off with noodles still in your mouth! Again!
speaker_akali: Sorry, I’m just exhausted from all our late nights training.
speaker_noodle_bill: Training! My, my. What sport do you play?
	[Option 1] …Golf!
	[Option 2] …Soccer?
	[Option 3] …Baseball?!
speaker_akali: Uh… Tennis?!?!
speaker_noodle_bill: …Tennis.
speaker_noodle_bill: Well, I’m sure you’re both very hard workers! At tennis. The game you both play.
speaker_kaisa: W-we are!
speaker_akali: …Alright, that’s it for me. Thanks for the noodles, Noodle Bill. Tasty as always.
speaker_akali: Kai’sa, you got this one?
speaker_kaisa: But you ordered three bowls…
speaker_akali: Thanks so much!
speaker_kaisa: ...Great. Gonna have to beg dad for more spending money.
speaker_noodle_bill: …You’re a good friend.
speaker_kaisa: Not good enough.
speaker_noodle_bill: Hmm?
speaker_kaisa: I used to be a better friend, but lately…
speaker_kaisa: Life’s just become so complicated.
speaker_noodle_bill: You want some more advice from a wise, old cook?
speaker_kaisa: …Sure.
speaker_noodle_bill: It never gets any easier.
	[Option 1] Thank you?
	speaker_noodle_bill: Gah hah! You’re welcome.
	speaker_kaisa: But couldn’t it? Get easier, I mean. If I figure out a plan of attack. Face my problems… head on…?
	speaker_noodle_bill: You solve one problem, another takes its place.
	speaker_kaisa: Heh. Now you sound like Akali.
	[Option 2] Well, that’s not very helpful.
	speaker_noodle_bill: Gah hah! I didn’t say it was helpful advice.
	speaker_kaisa: But if life is so hard… then why do you seem so happy?
	speaker_noodle_bill: I have good customers and great friends! Friends like my pork broth.
	[Option 3] …Maybe you should stick to making noodles.
	speaker_noodle_bill: Gah hah! Maybe I should!
	speaker_noodle_bill: But if we all did only what was comfortable, the future would be written in stone.
	speaker_kaisa: So... I’m just supposed to act impulsively?
	speaker_kaisa: That’s more Akali’s thing.
speaker_noodle_bill: Trust in your friend. She trusts in you.
speaker_kaisa: If that’s true, she doesn’t show it.
speaker_noodle_bill: That just means she needs you to trust in her even more. So sayeth Noodle Bill!
speaker_kaisa: Heh. Thanks, Noodle Bill.
speaker_noodle_bill: …Ahem.
speaker_kaisa: Oh… uh… Put it on our tab.
----------
Akali Act 2
----------
speaker_kaisa: Akali?
speaker_kaisa: Akali?
speaker_kaisa: [She’s ten minutes late. I’m starting to think she isn’t going to show.]
speaker_kaisa: [What did she want to talk about anyways?]
speaker_kaisa: [Something so important that she’d call an “Emergency Star Guardian Meeting...”]
speaker_kaisa: [And then not even bother to come?]
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_kaisa: [Maybe I’m being too hard on her. Maybe she just forgot. Maybe…]
speaker_kaisa: [No, she wouldn’t!]
speaker_kaisa: [But just to be sure…]
----------
speaker_kaisa: Akali?
speaker_noodle_bill: Oh, hello, Miss Kai’Sa! One bowl of miso coming up—
speaker_kaisa: I’m not here to eat, Noodle Bill. I’m looking for Akali.
speaker_noodle_bill: Hhrm. That’s odd. She was right here.
speaker_kaisa: Of course. She vanished, huh?
speaker_noodle_bill: Suppose so. Not sure what to do with this half-eaten bowl though...
speaker_akali: Bill! Could I get a take-away thingy? I could chow down on this food all day.
speaker_akali: Oh. Uh… Hey, Kai’Sa.
speaker_kaisa: What are you doing here?
speaker_akali: …Eating noodles? It’s Noodle Bill’s. Noodle is right there in the name.
speaker_kaisa: You asked me to meet you in the park. You said it was an emergency.
speaker_akali: Did I? That doesn’t sound like me.
speaker_kaisa: Yeah, I guess you’re right. You’re more the “hide from your problems” type.
speaker_akali: Hey, I have a particular set of skills. And, like, fifty different kinds of star knives.
speaker_noodle_bill: One bowl to go—
speaker_kaisa: I don’t get you, Akali.
speaker_noodle_bill: —Oh look, my chicken feet are running away. Better go catch them.
speaker_akali: Not much to get. I sleep, I study, I eat ramen…
speaker_akali: I fight the forces of darkness…
speaker_kaisa: And you do it all without a care in the world.
speaker_akali: Oh, I care. I care a lot.
speaker_kaisa: You constantly miss training, you fall asleep in class, you spend all your free time here—
speaker_kaisa: So what is it that you care about?
speaker_akali: ...
speaker_akali: Sorry I don’t care enough. Should I act more like you?
speaker_akali: Should I follow my friends around like a little bunny, desperate for them to like me?
speaker_kaisa: I’m trying to lead a team. These exercises are important.
speaker_akali: I don’t think that’s it. I think you’re trying to lead Lux’s team. I think you’re trying to lead Ahri’s team.
speaker_akali: But we can’t be them. I’m not Janna, or Poppy, or Soraka, or Sarah Fortune. I’m me. And you’re you. Our squad doesn't even have matching gem shapes!
speaker_akali: You’re chasing someone else’s standards. And those guys aren’t here to pat you on the head and tell you what a good little Star Guardian you are.
speaker_akali: We’re in high school. And there are things out there that want to kill us, whether you like it or not. We’re gonna lose someone, someday, and no amount of rules following can stop it.
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_akali: Sorry, was that too real? I know how much you like never talking about this.
	[Option 1] Yeah. You really don’t pull your punches.
	speaker_akali: I never got pulling punches.
	speaker_akali: What’s the point of hitting if it doesn’t hurt?
	speaker_kaisa: Oh, I don’t know… You can spare your friend’s feelings?
	speaker_kaisa: Though I do prefer honesty over constantly deflecting with stupid jokes.
	[Option 2] No. I mean—yes, but it was the good kind of real.
	speaker_akali: Thanks. It was totally intentional.
	speaker_akali: Definitely not a defense mechanism triggered by my best friend attacking me.
	speaker_kaisa: Ah… and now you’re back to deflecting with sarcasm and stupid jokes.
	[Option 3] Is anything really real? …That’s what you sound like.
	speaker_akali: I do not sound like that.
	speaker_kaisa: Yeah, I guess your nihilism usually falls on the more depressing, less philosophical side of the spectrum.
	speaker_akali: Sorry, what? My doesn’t-care-slacker brain is too small for your big, giant words.
	speaker_kaisa: Ah… and now you’re back to deflecting with sarcasm and stupid jokes.
speaker_akali: My jokes are smart, though. College-graduate-level smart.
speaker_akali: They go to medical school. Call me Nurse Akali, because I—
speaker_kaisa: So what is it you wanted to talk about? How we’re all going to die?
speaker_akali: …I mean, yeah, I guess?
speaker_akali: You don’t acknowledge how scary this is. What we do every day.
speaker_kaisa: I thought you loved fighting?
speaker_akali: It’s not the fighting. I signed up for the fighting.
speaker_akali: It's...
----------
speaker_akali: I have this dream. Different than all the other ones.
speaker_akali: I’m back at the Battle of the Twilight Star.
speaker_akali: People are screaming out for help.
speaker_akali: I reach for my weapon… but it’s not there.
speaker_akali: I look down and realize I’m in my school uniform.
speaker_akali: I’m not a guardian.
speaker_akali: Suddenly, the screams fade away. I know they’re still there… but I can’t hear them.
speaker_akali: I should feel bad. Horrible, even. But I don’t.
speaker_akali: I feel… relief.
----------
speaker_kaisa: And then you wake up?
speaker_akali: No, I hit the snooze button a couple more times.
speaker_kaisa: Akali…
speaker_akali: Have you ever thought about what it’s like to fall?
speaker_kaisa: I—
speaker_akali: It must be horrible. Right? That’s why we keep having those bad dreams, that’s why I keep hearing things…
speaker_akali: To burn out… to become… something else. Or fade away entirely. Is that what Zoe was? A Star Guardian who fell? She seemed pretty happy about it.
speaker_akali: I want to be a team player, Kai. But you never want to talk about that night. Or what the old guardians actually went through.
speaker_akali: So… sometimes it’s easier for me to imagine what it’s like to fall…
speaker_akali: …than it is for me to imagine doing… that… forever.
speaker_kaisa: We’re still new at it. Even Lux struggled—
speaker_akali: And Ahri made plenty of mistakes. We met two of them. Actually… did I see Xayah the other day? No, that can’t be right…
speaker_kaisa: Exactly! We’re just like the old guardians!
speaker_akali: …No, we’re not like the old guardians! Listen to what I’m saying!
speaker_kaisa: I am listening! You don’t have to be like them!
speaker_akali: Yeah, and neither do you.
speaker_kaisa: I...
speaker_akali: ...
speaker_akali: Ah… hey, I’m being a total bummer. I should go home. Let’s forget we had this conversation, okay? No harm, no foul.
speaker_kaisa: No, wait, Kali!
speaker_akali: Later, skater!
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_kaisa: Ugh!
----------
Akali Act 3
----------
speaker_kaisa: [Akali hasn’t talked to me since that last time we hung out…]
speaker_kaisa: [I… didn’t handle that conversation well. If only Lux…]
speaker_kaisa: [No. No! If only I knew the right thing to say to her.]
speaker_kaisa: [But every time I try to get close… I only push her further away.]
speaker_noodle_bill: Sorry, we don’t open for a—
speaker_noodle_bill: Oh! Kai’Sa! I haven’t seen you in a while! I was starting to get a little worried!
speaker_kaisa: Hey, Bill.
speaker_kaisa: Don’t worry, I’m not here to eat. I thought maybe Akali would be here.
speaker_noodle_bill: Ah, my most frequent customer. I’m gonna be able to renovate my house thanks to that girl’s appetite, gyah hah!
speaker_noodle_bill: She’s already on her 32nd punch card for a free bowl every eight bowls.
speaker_kaisa: That’s… uh…
speaker_kaisa: It’s… oh, I know this…
speaker_noodle_bill: A lot of ramen.
speaker_noodle_bill: You know, she always finds a way to make me laugh. Your friend is very funny.
speaker_kaisa: She talks with you?
speaker_noodle_bill: Oh, sometimes. Other times, she just eats in silence. Tends to be the case with all my customers.
speaker_noodle_bill: But she’ll make this funny face when she’s slurping noodles. Always cracks me up.
speaker_kaisa: I know the one. So focused. Like if she lets a single noodle slip from her mouth…
speaker_noodle_bill: The world will end. Gyah hah!
speaker_kaisa: What... what does she say? When you talk?
speaker_noodle_bill: Don’t worry. She doesn’t spill any of your exciting teenager secrets, whatever they are. Plays a lot of Hyper Crystal Something-or-Other on her phone.
speaker_noodle_bill: She talks a lot about the future. Or… hm… the lack of it. Not as uncommon as you’d think for someone her age. When you’re young, you don’t have much for reference.
speaker_noodle_bill: One bad thing becomes… the only thing, because there’s nothing else to compare it to. She’s real vague about whatever it is. Not that it’s any of my business.
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_kaisa: When did I become a person she couldn’t talk to…?
speaker_noodle_bill: A traveler carrying five stones shares their weight with the empty-handed man.
speaker_kaisa: Bill, you can’t keep doing this to me. I have no idea what you’re saying.
speaker_noodle_bill: Gyah hah hah! Teenagers! Your problems are so small, but you think the future of the universe is at stake!
speaker_kaisa: …We do?
speaker_noodle_bill: Of course! Akali mentioned you’re the leader of your—what was it—ah! Tennis team.
speaker_noodle_bill: Balancing that with school… can’t be easy. I never played tennis, but, you know. I assume.
speaker_noodle_bill: On the other hand, I am an old cook with an abundance of time.
speaker_noodle_bill: I am the empty-handed man. Her problems are the—
speaker_kaisa: The stones. I get it. And I have my own stones?
speaker_noodle_bill: We all do.
speaker_noodle_bill: You just travel with her down that road. Carry your stones together, and I’m sure she’ll come around.
speaker_kaisa: …Thanks for the weird-but-helpful metaphor. I will.
----------
speaker_akali: ...
speaker_kaisa: Akali!
speaker_akali: Hey, Kai’Sa! Stalking me again?
	[Option 1] Actually, I was just at Noodle Bill’s and…
	[Option 2] Uh… No, I just happened to be walking by…
	[Option 3] This is sort of where I hang out, so technically, you’re stalking me…
speaker_akali: …I was joking.
speaker_kaisa: Oh. Yeah. I know.
speaker_akali: Seriously though, how’d you find me?
speaker_kaisa: Well, you’re not exactly hiding…
speaker_kaisa: Also the guys at the arcade said you threw a skeeball so hard it broke the machine, then stormed off to “that stupid statue.”
speaker_akali: Threw it overhand. Like in the major leagues.
speaker_akali: ...
speaker_akali: So… what? Am I late for training or something?
speaker_kaisa: Sorry, no, nothing like that. We… we don’t have to talk about Star Guardian stuff. If you don’t want to.
speaker_akali: Great.
speaker_akali: ...
speaker_akali: Though… Do you think they’ll make statues of us one day? You know… if we don’t all, uh, die horribly?
	[Option 1] After all the world saving we’re gonna do? Definitely.
	speaker_akali: How can you be so sure?
	speaker_kaisa: …I’m not.
	speaker_kaisa: But I know you wouldn’t be doing this if all you cared about was a statue.
	speaker_akali: Yeah, I’m more of a billboard person. Captures my image better.
	[Option 2] I don’t know. You have to be a pretty big hero to get a statue.
	speaker_akali: Yeah… you’re probably right.
	speaker_akali: It’s easier if we don’t try to live up to Lux’s standards.
	speaker_kaisa: Yeah, you were right. We can forge our own path.
	speaker_akali: I want to be the first Star Guardian with an instant noodle brand. So much sodium your heart explodes right there at the table.
	[Option 3] If they do, I hope it’s one where we shoot water out of our mouths.
	speaker_akali: Ooh, and at night, there’s a water show set to music.
	speaker_kaisa: They can play our theme song! You know, the… burning one? Oh, no… I don’t know the theme song!
	speaker_akali: You?! You, little miss leader, don’t know Burning Bright?
	speaker_akali: This is an incredible day. Wow. I’m telling the entire squad. Nonnegotiable.
speaker_kaisa: Ha ha ha!
speaker_kaisa: Ahhh, whew.
speaker_kaisa: You know, I’m scared of falling, too.
speaker_akali: Really?
speaker_kaisa: Of course. I think about the invasion all the time… Rakan died right in front of us… thousands of people lost their lives… and everyone just… moved on.
speaker_kaisa: I wonder… is that what it’ll always be? Losing people we care about forever… until we lose each other? Ourselves? It doesn’t seem right. It doesn’t seem… fair.
speaker_kaisa: And part of me wishes I could just go back to before. Before all that happened, before Zoe attacked, before we ever knew there was such a thing as Star Guardians.
speaker_kaisa: When you and I would hang out at the arcade. Or listen to music in my bedroom.
speaker_akali: Or make friendship bracelets?
speaker_kaisa: Yeah… Man, they’re so janky. So embarrassing. If anyone tries to take mine, I’ll kill them.
speaker_kaisa: Ha! Well… no matter what we do, that old life is gone now.
speaker_kaisa: But the Kai’Sa from before? Your friend Kai’Sa? She’s not gone.
speaker_akali: You’ve been talking to old Bill too much. Did he tell you about the five rocks made of problems or whatever?
speaker_kaisa: The problem rocks! I still don’t know what he was talking about. Maybe I never will.
speaker_akali: Yeah… You know, it’s kinda funny.
speaker_akali: The danger we face every day. Our oath. The darkness.
speaker_kaisa: You’re right, that is very funny.
speaker_akali: Heh, shut up. It’s all so… overwhelming. And when I’m overwhelmed…
speaker_kaisa: You make a joke?
speaker_akali: Yeah! A really stupid one. Like, I call a pigeon a sky goblin.
speaker_kaisa: AHAHAHA! A WHAT?!
speaker_akali: A sky goblin! Because they gobble treasure and tell riddles!
speaker_kaisa: Ak.. ahaha.. Akali… what do you think a goblin is?
speaker_akali: I know what a goblin is! Hey, stop laughing! You’re gonna make me… ahaha!
speaker_kaisa: Ah… oh… oh… my sides…
speaker_akali: Ahhh, whew. Hey… whatever happens… let’s just try to be there for each other, okay? You did promise, after all.
speaker_kaisa: You’re right, Kali. I did.
speaker_akali: Friends ‘til the end? Even if that end super turbo sucks?
speaker_kaisa: You and me, Kali. Until the sucky, turbo end.
----------
speaker_kaisa: …Pfft. Sky goblins.

Ekko Act 1
----------
speaker_prof_ikari: Alright, there’s no way you’ll be able to compute this equation at such a speed.
speaker_ekko: Try me.
speaker_ekko: R-respectfully, ma'am. Ahem.
speaker_kaisa: [Hm. Professor Ikari’s been testing Ekko to see if he can answer different math problems… before she can type them into a calculator.]
speaker_kaisa: [He’s using his Star Guardian powers right out in the open. Idiot!]
speaker_prof_ikari: 38,472,938 multiplied by 238,492. You have—
speaker_ekko: 9,175,487,929,496.00
speaker_prof_ikari: That’s… correct!
speaker_ekko: What can I say? This man’s got all the answers.
speaker_akali: Show off.
speaker_akali: If I could rewind time, I definitely wouldn’t use it to impress my math class.
speaker_kaisa: You’d probably go back to last week, when you fell on your face in front of the entire class.
speaker_akali: Akali, you fool! Why didn’t you double knot your laces?!
speaker_kaisa: …Do you think we should talk to him?
speaker_akali: Ekko? What, for the answers to the big test on Friday?
speaker_kaisa: No! Talk to him about misusing his Star Guardian abilities.
speaker_akali: This again? You worry too much. I mean, it’s not like he’s gonna get caught.
speaker_akali: And even if he does, he can just rewind time to before he gets caught. Problem solved.
speaker_kaisa: Problem not solved.
speaker_kaisa: Being a Star Guardian is about responsibility. Honor. Loyal—
speaker_akali: I took the oath the same day as you. We’re co-leaders. Not that anyone seems to remember…
speaker_akali: If it’s bugging you so much, go talk to the kid. Use your powers of being a giant buzzkill.
speaker_kaisa: Fine. I will.
----------
speaker_kaisa: [There he is… It's like he’s avoiding me…]
speaker_kaisa: Ekko! Hey!
speaker_ekko: Oh! Hey, captain ‘Kai!
speaker_kaisa: Been asking around for you. Feel like I keep showing up right after you leave.
speaker_kaisa: Chess club, advanced physics…
speaker_ekko: I try to keep busy.
speaker_kaisa: How strange. I sort of have that problem, too…
speaker_ekko: I can’t hang out this weekend.
speaker_ekko: I have a… project I’m working on.
speaker_kaisa: I didn’t ask you to hang out.
speaker_ekko: Oh. Well, you were going to.
speaker_kaisa: You’ve already had this conversation before, haven’t you?
speaker_ekko: Just a few times.
speaker_ekko: There were a couple repeats where I managed to sneak away. Those were my favorites.
	[Option 1] So you were avoiding me? I knew it!
	[Option 2] Well, this version of me managed to track you down.
	[Option 3] That’s it, hand over the time egg before you summon a planet-eating lava parasite.
speaker_ekko: …Sure.
speaker_kaisa: You can’t keep doing this, Ekko. Rewinding conversations so you say the right thing. Rewinding math class so you have the right answer…
speaker_ekko: I’m not cheating at math! Why do you always say that?
speaker_kaisa: You’re not?
speaker_ekko: No. I’m just good at solving advanced equations in my head.
speaker_kaisa: [Huh. Guess that makes sense. The kid is a brainiac, after all.]
speaker_kaisa: Well, I apologize.
speaker_kaisa: But my point stands.
speaker_ekko: And what point was that… captain?
speaker_kaisa: My point was that, as your cap… Ugh, I’m telling you to only use your abilities to…
speaker_ekko: Protect the universe?
speaker_kaisa: Hmph. Nice guess.
speaker_ekko: Wasn’t a guess. And… you don’t have to worry. I can never change the past anyways. Not when it really matters.
speaker_ekko: Look… I should get going.
speaker_kaisa: Wait.
	[Option 1] What exactly is the project you’re working on?
	speaker_ekko: It’s a surprise. Or a… secret.
	speaker_kaisa: Is it dangerous?
	speaker_ekko: Uuuuh. No?
	speaker_kaisa: Good.
	[Option 2] Do you have the math homework?
	speaker_ekko: You seriously want to cheat off me?
	speaker_ekko: After making me feel bad for cheating?
	speaker_ekko: When I didn’t even cheat?
	speaker_kaisa: I-I wasn’t going to cheat. I just wanted to… compare answers.
	[Option 3] What am I going to say next?
	speaker_ekko: “That wasn’t what I was gonna say. “
	speaker_kaisa: That wasn’t what I was gonna s—
	speaker_kaisa: I was… gonna… say “I—”
	speaker_kaisa: Stupid time powers.
speaker_ekko: See you around, Captain ‘Kai.
speaker_kaisa: [I’m not giving up on you that easy, kid.]
----------
speaker_ekko: ...
speaker_kaisa: [Okay, so following Ekko home might not have been a high point for me as a Star Guardian…]
speaker_kaisa: [...but I have to figure out what he’s up to.]
speaker_strange_machine: Wooooooshh. Icka icka icka icka…
speaker_kaisa: Wh-what is that?!
speaker_ekko: Huh. You’re earlier than last time… captain.
speaker_kaisa: [Oh, shoot.]
----------
Ekko Act 2
----------
speaker_ekko: Inventor’s Log: After a few setbacks, I’m prepared to proceed with ChronoDisplacer Test 91.
speaker_ekko: Recalibrated the internal zeptometer for more accurate retrieval to the millisecond.
speaker_kaisa: [It’s been a few weeks since I followed Ekko home…]
speaker_kaisa: [He was mad at first when he found out. But then he seemed to forget about it…]
speaker_kaisa: [And now, out of the blue, he invites me over. What’s he playing at?]
speaker_ekko: Kai’Sa! You’re just in time!
speaker_kaisa: Just in time for what exactly?
speaker_ekko: To witness the first successful test of my ChronoDisplacer!
speaker_kaisa: Chrono…
speaker_ekko: Displacer!
speaker_ekko: The title is a work in progress.
speaker_kaisa: So, this is the “project” you’ve been working on?
speaker_kaisa: The one that’s been keeping you from coming to training?
speaker_kaisa: And the reason you missed Mandatory Mochi Monday?
speaker_ekko: Yeah, sorry I’ve been slacking on my Star Guardian duties… though uh, nobody likes the mandatory Mondays. Just an FYI.
speaker_ekko: But once I get this working, I’ll be back full time. I promise.
speaker_kaisa: Ugh… fine. So what exactly does this thing do?
speaker_ekko: Oh… uh, yeah, I should explain.
speaker_ekko: When I became a Star Guardian, the First Light gave me the power to go back in time...
speaker_kaisa: I remember, Ekko. I was there.
speaker_ekko: Oh yeah! I’ll, uh… skip ahead.
speaker_ekko: I’ve been experimenting... looking for a way to amplify my abilities.
speaker_ekko: I want to increase the distance I can travel backward. The longer the better.
speaker_kaisa: Where are you trying to go?
speaker_ekko: Not where. When!
speaker_kaisa: What?!
speaker_ekko: Normally, I can only travel back as far as three minutes.
speaker_ekko: But with the help of this machine, I should be able to travel as far back as three years!
speaker_ekko: Isn’t that awesome?!
	[Option 1] Yeah… sure! I guess!
	[Option 2] That’s not exactly the word I would use to describe it.
	[Option 3] What would happen if an insect got into the machine when it’s powered on?
speaker_ekko: …Why aren’t you excited about it?
speaker_ekko: Just think of the possibilities!
speaker_kaisa: I thought you said you couldn’t change the past. And why would you even…?
speaker_ekko: I just wasn’t thinking hard enough.
speaker_kaisa: …Wait. Didn’t this neighborhood get hit during the invasion…? The night Zoe attacked…
speaker_ekko: I know I can do it. I know I can go back. I just need to figure out a few more things…
speaker_kaisa: …What happened, Ekko?
speaker_ekko: Just have to get there one minute sooner… Even a moment…
speaker_kaisa: Ekko...
speaker_ekko: I’m stronger now. I’m ready.
speaker_kaisa: Ekko.
speaker_kaisa: You can talk to me, okay? That’s why you asked me to come here, right? To open up, and get this off your chest?
speaker_ekko: …Wait, what? Pfft, no.
speaker_ekko: Whatever singalongs you’re doing with the rest of the team, that ain’t me. Nice try, though.
speaker_ekko: I just need someone to help me operate the machine.
	[Option 1] What would I have to do? Push a few buttons?
	speaker_ekko: Uh… it’s a little bit more complicated than that.
	speaker_ekko: What do you know about relativity?
	speaker_kaisa: Whatever we learned in school.
	speaker_ekko: We haven’t had a lecture on relativity this year.
	speaker_kaisa: Oh, okay. Then nothing.
	speaker_kaisa: Just like I know nothing about what you have planned.
	[Option 2] Wow. Rude.
	speaker_ekko: You don’t want me doing something dangerous alone, do you?
	speaker_kaisa: I mean, no…
	speaker_ekko: So, you’ll help?
	speaker_kaisa: Oh, come on… This is emotional manipulation!
	[Option 3] I don’t even have my driver’s license. Should I be operating heavy machinery?
	speaker_ekko: I won’t tell if you won’t.
	speaker_kaisa: We could hurt someone…
	speaker_ekko: We won’t. If it works, no one is going to get hurt.
	speaker_kaisa: …Hm. Alright, what do you have planned?
speaker_ekko: …I suppose I do owe you an explanation.
----------
speaker_ekko: I was out at the arcade with my friend…
speaker_ekko: When Zoe attacked the city.
speaker_ekko: …! What’s happening?! Is that… some sort of monster?
speaker_unknown: Ekko! Look out!
speaker_ekko: I thought he was warning me. But when I turned around, I saw him under the rubble.
----------
speaker_ekko: He came out of his coma, but… the doctors still aren’t sure if he’ll walk again.
speaker_kaisa: So… you think you can save him if you go back to that night.
speaker_ekko: If I can get there before. If I can warn him…
speaker_kaisa: You know, sometimes the past—
speaker_ekko: I’m doing this, Captain. Either you can help me, or you can leave.
speaker_ekko: I don’t care about when or where we’re “allowed” to use our powers, or how they’re supposed to be used, or whatever dumb rules you come up with. This is my choice.
speaker_kaisa: Ekko, I’m only… Okay. I’ll do it. Let’s change the past.
speaker_kaisa: How do we get this thing going?
----------
Ekko Act 3
----------
speaker_kaisa: [So, our first test didn’t work. The machine puttered out, generating some weird, blue gas.]
speaker_kaisa: [Second test failed, too. And the third.]
speaker_ekko: Inventor’s Log: This is ChronoDisplacer Test 143.
speaker_kaisa: [Yeah, we’ve been at it for a while.]
speaker_ekko: After numerous failed attempts with an operator in the present…
speaker_ekko: We will now proceed with two travelers, one to monitor an active connection with…
speaker_kaisa: [It’s hard for me to pay attention when he starts rambling on about all this time stuff.]
speaker_kaisa: [But… I’m going with him! He gave me a device to pull us back if anything goes wrong.]
speaker_ekko: …and, this time, nothing will go wrong.
speaker_ekko: Are you ready?
	[Option 1] Let’s do this.
	[Option 2] Not in the slightest. But what choice do we have?
	[Option 3] Could you tell me what I have to do again? I… wasn’t listening.
	speaker_ekko: No time to explain.
speaker_ekko: It’s now or never.
speaker_ekko: Entering chrono-coordinates…
speaker_kaisa: Digitizing quantum polarity…
speaker_ekko: That’s… That’s not a thing.
speaker_kaisa: Just trying to help.
speaker_kaisa: …Ahem. Turning on the Stopwatch of Perfect Timing…
speaker_ekko: Name not final. Patent pending.
speaker_kaisa: Synchronized! If you’re gonna do something, do it now!
speaker_ekko: Alright… Here goes nothing!
----------
speaker_ekko: Kai’Sa?
speaker_kaisa: Checking the stopwatch to confirm accurate arrival time…
speaker_ekko: No need. Look at the skyline.
speaker_kaisa: That’s… Zoe… the Twilight Star… We’re back to that night…
speaker_kaisa: You did it, Ekko.
speaker_ekko: We did it.
speaker_civilian: Wh… What is that?! Run! Run for your lives!
speaker_kaisa: Quick, transform. Even if this is the past, that’s still Zoe. The old guardians are fighting her right now, and it is not pretty.
speaker_kaisa: Alright, what’s the game plan?
speaker_ekko: You really weren’t listening to me at all, were you?
speaker_ekko: We have to track down past me. Ignore everything else. I maaaay have neglected to mention the effects of messing with history too much.
speaker_kaisa: Those are lies of omission! I… ugh! Just lead the way…
----------
speaker_past_ekko: Let’s get out of here!
speaker_claggor: Just a second! My friend needs help!
speaker_past_ekko: Claggor, hurry! The entire city is falling apart!
speaker_kaisa: Wow, you look pretty much the same.
speaker_ekko: It was last year, Kai. Not last century.
speaker_kaisa: True. And that other boy… That’s your friend?
speaker_ekko: Yeah. That’s Claggor.
speaker_kaisa: And who’s—
speaker_kaisa: Wait a second…
speaker_ekko: Sona?
speaker_kaisa: Shhh!
speaker_kaisa: She hasn’t met us yet. Wouldn’t talking to her mess with—I don’t know—the fabric of reality?!
speaker_ekko: Oh, so you were listening!
speaker_kaisa: Only when it was interesting.
speaker_ekko: …Well, I don’t think she noticed us.
speaker_kaisa: Maybe not. But he did.
speaker_claggor: Hey, Sona! Don’t go running off on your own! …Wait, Ekko?
speaker_ekko: Hey, Claggor! Uh…
speaker_claggor: Didn’t I just see you leave? In the opposite direction? …And why are you dressed in cosplay?
speaker_ekko: I—no—there’s no way. I mean—
speaker_kaisa: Sorry, his little computer brain is malfunctioning.
speaker_kaisa: What he’s trying to say is that he… came back. Wanted to make sure you’re okay.
speaker_claggor: Yeah, well, nobody is okay right now. Something bad is happening outside… Wait, you’re also dressed in cosplay? This is weird.
speaker_kaisa: I’m… a friend.
speaker_ekko: …You-you need to get out of here!
speaker_claggor: Ah. You aren’t my Ekko, are you? Or you are, but… Well, you know.
speaker_ekko: How—?
speaker_claggor: I always knew you’d figure out a way to time travel! We’ve been talking about it for years!
speaker_claggor: Did you use a wormhole? Did you figure out a way to alter the geometry of space-time?!
speaker_ekko: …There’s no time.
speaker_claggor: I’m sure you’ll tell future me all about it, right? Right? Ekko… Am I right..?
speaker_claggor: Wait… Why are you here?
speaker_ekko: …I’m not going to let it happen. Not again.
speaker_claggor: What? What happens to me?
speaker_ekko: ...
speaker_kaisa: You get hurt. Saving someone else.
speaker_claggor: Do I look cool while doing it?
speaker_ekko: This isn’t a joke, Claggor!
speaker_ekko: I’m-I’m a Star Guardian now. It’s my job to keep you safe.
speaker_claggor: Huh? What’s a Star Guardian? Are they, like… superheroes?
speaker_kaisa: That’s right… The invasion made the guardians public knowledge! Nobody knows they even exist until tomorrow morning!
speaker_ekko: Yeah, they’re like superheroes. I took an oath and everything…
speaker_claggor: An oath, huh? Like, protect the innocent, defeat evil? All that?
speaker_claggor: Which means your job is to protect people. Not keep me from making my own decisions.
speaker_ekko: But you get hurt!
speaker_claggor: And what about the person I save? What happens to them if you stop me?
speaker_ekko: I...
speaker_sona: …!
speaker_sona: …..…!
speaker_kaisa: He’s right, Ekko.
speaker_ekko: But we traveled all this way!
	[Option 1] You’ve done all you can, Ekko.
	speaker_ekko: No… I won’t give up.
	speaker_claggor: It’s not giving up, Ekko.
	speaker_claggor: It’s just acceptance.
	[Option 2] Just let him go. It’s over.
	speaker_claggor: …Over? Jeez…
	speaker_kaisa: Oh! I didn’t mean it like that! Don’t worry. You survive… mostly.
	speaker_ekko: But you don’t have to get hurt at all…
	speaker_claggor: It’s okay.
	speaker_ekko: No. I won’t give up.
	speaker_claggor: It’s not giving up, Ekko.
	speaker_claggor: It’s just acceptance.
	[Option 3] Maybe we should just be glad we made it here in one piece.
	speaker_ekko: The machine works perfectly.
	speaker_kaisa: It almost exploded on trial 104.
	speaker_ekko: We were still working out the kinks.
	speaker_ekko: And it was all for this moment. So, I won’t give up.
	speaker_claggor: It’s not giving up, Ekko.
	speaker_claggor: It’s just acceptance.
speaker_claggor: You’ve read all the same sci-fi mangas as me… You know you can’t change the past.
speaker_ekko: You’re so stubborn.
speaker_claggor: Why do you think we get along so well?
speaker_ekko: Best friends forever?
speaker_claggor: Yeah… Always. Until the end of time.
speaker_ekko: ...
speaker_kaisa: Are you… okay?
speaker_ekko: No. But I think I will be.
speaker_ekko: Take us home.
speaker_kaisa: …Retrieving coordinates…
----------
speaker_ekko: Thanks, Kai’Sa.
speaker_kaisa: Yeah, no problem. I just had to push a button.
speaker_ekko: No. For everything.
----------
Kaisa Act 1
----------
speaker_akali: You sure you’re okay with doing this, Kai?
speaker_kaisa: It’s not like we have any other choice.
----------
speaker_akali: I mean… you could come with us?
speaker_kaisa: You know I can’t. Someone has to look after Valoran City.
speaker_kaisa: Someone has to look after… them.
speaker_chiizu: I promise we won’t be a bother, Miss Kai’Sa.
speaker_kaisa: I’m not worried about you, Chiizu. But some of your friends…
speaker_umi: [Angry screech!]
speaker_akali: Umi didn’t appreciate what you were implying.
speaker_kaisa: Yeah… I heard. [Ouch. My ears.]
speaker_kaisa: But don’t worry, Akali. I didn’t really want to go on the field trip anyway…
speaker_akali: Because you hate fun?
speaker_kaisa: …No! I like fun.
speaker_akali: Hmph. Coulda fooled me.
speaker_kaisa: I went to the capital once when I was younger. Not much to see. Lots of buildings.
speaker_akali: Yeah, I bet. Staying home and looking after a bunch of weird pets sounds way cooler than seeing history come alive at the world’s only matcha museum.
	[Option 1] That wasn’t on the class itinerary!
	speaker_akali: Who said anything about following the class itinerary?
	speaker_akali: I need a vacation.
	speaker_kaisa: [Yeah… I could use one, too.]
	[Option 2] MATCHA MUSEUM?! Please tell me you’re joking.
	speaker_akali: Wish I was. I love to joke.
	speaker_akali: But I’ve never been more serious.
	speaker_kaisa: You’ll take lots of photos, right?
	speaker_akali: Of course! But I don’t think they let us take ‘em during the tasting tour.
	speaker_kaisa: TASTING TOUR?!?!?!
	[Option 3] You can’t make me jealous. I have plenty of exciting activities planned!
	speaker_akali: Oh, really? What?
	speaker_kaisa: Uh… I was gonna hang out with some friends from school.
	speaker_akali: We’re your friends from school. Try again.
	speaker_kaisa: …Go to the hot springs and have a spa day?
	speaker_akali: You? Relax?! Good one.
	speaker_kaisa: [Sigh] …I was going to catch up on homework.
	speaker_akali: Yep, there’s the ugly truth.
speaker_kaisa: Well, one of us has to be responsible…
speaker_akali: Spare me the self-sacrificing monologue, Kai. Sorry, Captain Kai, of the Star Guardians. Bwahaha!
speaker_akali: See you in a week! Later, skater.
speaker_akali: Oh, and Umi… don’t go too hard on her. Heh.
speaker_umi: [Sad chirp.]
speaker_kaisa: She’ll be back, Umi.
speaker_umi: [Confused chirp.]
speaker_kaisa: No, no! You need to stay behind, with me!
speaker_ina: [Excited cheep!]
speaker_kaisa: That’s right, Ina. We’re gonna have a lot of fun.
speaker_umi: [Doubtful chirp.]
speaker_kaisa: Yeah, yeah, you’re used to doing fun things with Akali.
speaker_kaisa: But maybe my definition of fun is just different! Did you ever consider that?
speaker_aru: [Declarative bahhh.]
speaker_kaisa: Well, I’m not really taking suggestions for activities, and—
speaker_waku: [Thoughtful boop.]
speaker_kaisa: That’s not in our budget, Waku! Dad has me on a very strict allowance!
speaker_chiizu: Please, everyone! Give Miss Kai’Sa some space.
speaker_kaisa: Thanks, Chiizu. You know, you’re the only one that—
speaker_chiizu: Though, now that I have a moment… I was wondering if perhaps we’d have some free time to go to a concert. There’s a great singer in town, and I thought we might float by.
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_chiizu: …What?
speaker_chiizu: OH, NO! I spoke out of turn, didn’t I? I’M SO SORRY!
speaker_kaisa: ……!
speaker_kaisa: Listen up, everybody!
speaker_kaisa: I know our friends are off having fun, exploring a cool city, enjoying delicious food…
speaker_umi: [Impatient chirp.]
speaker_kaisa: Umi! Jeez, for a manta ray you sure act like an evil empress. Okay, I’ll get to the point—
speaker_kaisa: We have work to do.
speaker_chiizu: Miss Kai’Sa, I don’t really know anything about high-school physics. I’m a soulful being with the heart of a poet.
speaker_kaisa: I’m not talking about homework.
speaker_kaisa: I’m talking about being the best Star Guardians we can be!
speaker_chiizu: Oh—well, we aren’t really guardians, per se…
speaker_waku: [Helpful beep boop.]
speaker_chiizu: Yes! That’s right, Waku. We are simply adorable companions meant to distract and delight.
speaker_chiizu: We aren’t meant to see… combat.
speaker_umi: [Combative chirp!]
speaker_chiizu: Okay, some of us aren’t meant to see combat. Unless we’re transforming weapons, sentient guns-slash-knives, or we explode when thrown.
speaker_kaisa: Well, times have changed, Chiizu.
speaker_kaisa: When the rest of the guardians come back, we’ll show them that practice makes—
speaker_aru: [Overly excited bah!]
speaker_kaisa: No… perfect, not paninis. But I appreciate the enthusiasm.
speaker_aru: [Destitute bah.]
speaker_kaisa: We can get paninis later.
speaker_kaisa: Ina!
speaker_kaisa: You’re gonna have to be my right-hand… rabbit this week.
speaker_kaisa: You up to the challenge?
speaker_ina: [Enthusiastic cheep.]
speaker_kaisa: I can’t offer you a salary.
speaker_ina: [Less enthusiastic cheep.]
speaker_kaisa: You’ll do it anyway? Great.
speaker_chiizu: Miss Kai’Sa—
speaker_kaisa: Ina, wait! I didn’t tell you what I need help with… Stars alive, why are there so many of you?
speaker_chiizu: Miss Kai’Sa—
speaker_kaisa: Hmm. Okay… we can spar on Sunday, run some drills after school on Monday…
speaker_chiizu: Miss—
speaker_kaisa: Then, Tuesday, I have journalism club…
speaker_chiizu: MISS KAI’SA!
speaker_kaisa: What, Chiizu?! What is so important?!
speaker_kaisa: Let me guess…
	[Option 1] Aru headbutted you again, and you want to write them a sternly worded letter?
	[Option 2] Waku won’t stop beatboxing even after you asked nicely?
	[Option 3] Ina is bragging about the new—well-deserved—responsibilities I gave them?
speaker_chiizu: No…
speaker_chiizu: Umi flew off. They’re missing.
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_chiizu: Are you mad?
speaker_kaisa: …………
speaker_chiizu: Because you look mad.
----------
Kaisa Act 2
----------
speaker_kaisa: Umi?!
speaker_ina: [Worried cheep.]
speaker_kaisa: I don’t think Umi is around here, Ina.
speaker_chiizu: Oh, dear. OH, DEAR! We’re going to be in so much trouble.
speaker_kaisa: We’ll find Umi. They can’t have gone far.
speaker_waku: [Purposeful boop.]
speaker_kaisa: They wouldn’t have gone into the sewer, Waku.
speaker_waku: [Insistent beep.]
speaker_kaisa: Yeah, no, obviously! I’ll go in the sewer! In the sewer with all the sewage! Let me check right now!
speaker_kaisa: …Nothing.
speaker_waku: [Bashful beep.]
speaker_aru: [Hopeless bah.]
speaker_kaisa: Don’t say that. Umi is out there somewhere.
speaker_kaisa: …We’ll search all of Valoran City if we have to.
speaker_chiizu: Great idea, Miss Kai’Sa! I know just where to start!
----------
speaker_kaisa: …The school? Your great idea is… the school?
speaker_kaisa: Why, Chiizu? Why would Umi come here?
speaker_chiizu: To learn, of course!
speaker_kaisa: The entire school is on a field trip.
speaker_chiizu: NOOOO! I’ve led the team astray!
speaker_chiizu: I’m a terrible Star Guardian!!! Or adorable Star Guardian familiar! I don’t remember where we landed on that.
speaker_waku: [Defensive boop beep.]
speaker_kaisa: What do you mean Chiizu just needs some time to cool off? Cool off from what? He looks like a cartoon mouse!
speaker_waku: [Descriptive boop.]
speaker_kaisa: Oh, mother of… Yeah, alright, Waku. I’ll give him some space.
speaker_waku: [Thoughtful beep.]
speaker_kaisa: Huh… Well, there’s probably a better chance Umi would go there than school…
speaker_chiizu: YOU’RE RIGHT! IT WAS AN AWFUL IDEA! I’M SO, SO SORRY!
----------
speaker_kaisa: No sign of Umi.
speaker_waku: [Questioning boop beep.]
speaker_kaisa: I’m not going back up there to get you a “Special Cutie Surprise Special Menu Doughnut with Bonus Smooch.” That’s… I can’t even begin to describe how embarrassing that is.
speaker_waku: [Angry BOOP.]
speaker_kaisa: Wait a minute… Can you even eat food?
speaker_waku: [Ashamed beep.]
speaker_kaisa: That’s what I thought! You just want the Bonus Smooch! Which is probably just a sticker or something!
speaker_aru: [Very excited bah!]
speaker_kaisa: Now isn’t the time for games, Aru.
speaker_aru: [Insistent bah.]
speaker_kaisa: Oh! You think Umi’s at Arcade World?
speaker_aru: [Bah of agreement.]
speaker_kaisa: That makes sense! Akali loves that place, too…
speaker_kaisa: She’s always going on about how school is a prison and the arcade is where she does all her real learning.
speaker_kaisa: …Which would explain why she’s getting straight Cs.
speaker_aru: [Bored bah.]
speaker_kaisa: Sure, now I’m boring. Well, lead the way!
----------
speaker_kaisa: Umi’s not by the VALORANT machine…
speaker_aru: [Descriptive bah.]
speaker_kaisa: Not by the snacks either?
speaker_kaisa: Well then. They definitely aren’t here.
speaker_kaisa: Good try, Aru.
speaker_kaisa: Maybe we should just call it for today. Look again tomorrow?
speaker_ina: [Motivational cheep.]
speaker_kaisa: Hey! That’s my line. I’m the one who says, “We should never give up.” Unless we should give up… you know, for tactical reasons.
speaker_ina: [Even more motivational cheep.]
speaker_kaisa: Noodle Bill’s! It’s so obvious! How did I not think of that?
speaker_ina: [Constructive criticism cheep.]
speaker_kaisa: Of course I’m attentive to my team’s needs! It’s just, sometimes, I get so focused on Star Guardian work that I—
speaker_ina: [Sassy cheep.]
speaker_kaisa: I’m not making excuses. I…
speaker_kaisa: …W-we should get going! We’re coming for you, Umi!
----------
speaker_kaisa: …Bill? Are you open?
speaker_noodle_bill: Well, well, Miss Kai’Sa! I think I know why you’re here…
speaker_kaisa: Really? You’ve seen a floating… uh… manta ray… thing?
speaker_noodle_bill: …A what?
speaker_noodle_bill: I thought you were here to eat ramen…
	[Option 1] I… uh… Oh—I meant…
	[Option 2] Ramen! Yes, of course! That’s why I’m here!
	[Option 3] Floating manta ray!? That would be crazy. Not something I know about…
speaker_noodle_bill: Ha! The look on your face!
speaker_noodle_bill: Yeah, I’ve seen your pet…
speaker_noodle_bill: …And I see you’ve brought more of them. A lot more. An entire little zoo.
speaker_kaisa: These things? Uh… yes. They’re my pets!
speaker_aru: [Baaah!]
speaker_noodle_bill: Quite… uh… exotic animals.
speaker_noodle_bill: And very talkative, too… This one in particular.
speaker_kaisa: Umi! There you are! I’ve looked so many places for you! Places so far apart from one another! On foot!
speaker_kaisa: Sorry to bother you, Bill. We’ll get going now.
speaker_noodle_bill: Why not stay a while, Kai’Sa? I think you could use a break.
	[Option 1] Break? Why would I need a break?
	speaker_noodle_bill: I’m sure you’ve been running around all day looking for your lost… pet.
	speaker_kaisa: …I have.
	speaker_noodle_bill: You know what they say… “Before you take care of others, you must take care of yourself.” I came up with that, by the way. Trade secret.
	[Option 2] Oh, yes, please. I’m starving.
	speaker_noodle_bill: One tonkotsu, coming right up!
	speaker_kaisa: You wouldn’t believe the day I had…
	speaker_noodle_bill: I’m sure you’re exhausted. You always put so much on your plate!
	speaker_noodle_bill: The only thing on one’s plate that matters… is good food.
	[Option 3] No time, Bill. My many weird pets and I have combat drills to do.
	speaker_noodle_bill: Training? For what? Normal stuff, I’m sure, but hey, let’s talk about it.
	speaker_kaisa: Oh—a—uh… competition?
	speaker_noodle_bill: Hrm, a competition. You make your pets work as hard as you do!
	speaker_noodle_bill: Relax, Kai’Sa. If not for yourself… for them.
speaker_kaisa: Ah… that aroma… The Targon Park bicentennial special tonkotsu… but they only make it once a year...!
speaker_noodle_bill: I wrote that recipe, so really, it’s whenever I decide to make it. Gotta break the rules sometimes if you wanna live long! Wahaha!
speaker_kaisa: …Okay, okay. We’ll stay.

Kaisa Act 3
----------
speaker_kaisa: Good morning, everybody!
speaker_ina: [Surprised cheep.]
speaker_kaisa: I know! I can’t believe I slept in so late!
speaker_kaisa: But I’m actually feeling more refreshed than I have in… months.
speaker_ina: [Wry cheep.]
speaker_kaisa: There’s no need to say “I told you so…”
speaker_kaisa: But you were right. And Noodle Bill was right.
speaker_kaisa: It’s important to find a work/life/school/Star Guardian balance.
speaker_kaisa: I almost forgot what it was like to sleep in after staying up late watching documentaries… eating an acceptable number of healthy snacks… staying hydrated…
speaker_kaisa: You know, typical high schooler stuff!
speaker_ina: [Reluctantly questioning cheep.]
speaker_kaisa: Wh-what!? I can be a typical high schooler! I didn’t even make plans today!
speaker_kaisa: I’m chill Kai’Sa. I just go with the flow.
speaker_waku: [Suspicious boop.]
speaker_kaisa: No more drills. Promise.
speaker_kaisa: What do you want to do, Waku?
speaker_waku: [Questioning beep boop.]
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_kaisa: Does anyone have any suggestions that don’t involve time travel?
speaker_waku: [Disappointed beep.]
speaker_aru: [Feverish bah.]
speaker_kaisa: Rock surfing sounds pretty… cool… I guess…
speaker_aru: [Angry bah.]
speaker_kaisa: No! I’m not just saying that! I’m sure it’s a lot of fun.
speaker_aru: [Furious bah.]
speaker_kaisa: I just don’t know where the nearest quarry is… or how to surf… Also, rocks are very hard…
speaker_chiizu: I know something we all could do!
speaker_kaisa: Ooh! What, Chiizu?
speaker_chiizu: Watch more television!
speaker_kaisa: Wait… Did you stay up all night? You look… unwell.
speaker_chiizu: I had to finish the show we started…
speaker_chiizu: And then another show started…
speaker_chiizu: Do you know how many shows there are? THERE ARE SO MANY!!!
	[Option 1] Maybe you should get some sleep, little guy.
	speaker_chiizu: SLEEP?! I don’t need sleep! If I sleep, I can’t watch the screen!
	[Option 2] You’ll never be able to watch them all.
	speaker_chiizu: I can do it! I just need to watch several at the same time.
	speaker_kaisa: …But then they won’t make any sense to you.
	speaker_chiizu: It’s not about them making sense. It’s about sEEing aLL tHe piCTurES on tHe scrEEn!
	speaker_chiizu: I LOVE TV!!!!!
	[Option 3] I know! There are so many… and we didn’t even get to the ones on the internet…
	speaker_chiizu: Oh, no… How many shows are on there?
	speaker_kaisa: Unlimited. And a lot of them are free.
	speaker_chiizu: This is too much! I-I CAN’T PROCESS THIS INFORMATION!!!!
speaker_kaisa: Uh… Don’t worry, guys. I’m… sure… Chiizu will be okay.
speaker_kaisa: Umi! …We never really talked about what happened.
speaker_umi: [Feigned confused chirp.]
speaker_kaisa: You know exactly what I’m talking about.
speaker_kaisa: Why did you fly off?
speaker_umi: [Sad chirp.]
speaker_kaisa: Of course I’d notice if you were gone!
speaker_kaisa: You’re my best friend… ’s familiar. My best friend’s familiar.
speaker_umi: [Satisfied chirp.]
speaker_kaisa: Do you want to do something today?
	[Option 1] Maybe go to Arcade World? I think they fixed that broken fighting game!
	[Option 2] How about getting a pastry at the cafe? …Or maybe two pastries?
	[Option 3] I mean, rock surfing sounds kind of fun, right? We could try it!
speaker_chiizu: Forget that! We could watch more TV!
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_chiizu: I’m not addicted! I CAN STOP ANYTIME!
speaker_chiizu: It’s only one thousand episodes. How long can it take? [shivers]
speaker_umi: [Pleasant chirp.]
speaker_kaisa: A trip to the park sounds perfect, Umi.
speaker_kaisa: I know at least one of us could use some outdoor time.
speaker_chiizu: Hey, what are you doing? DON’T TOUCH THE REMOTE!
----------
speaker_umi: [Delighted chirps.]
speaker_ina: [Blissful cheeps.]
speaker_kaisa: Ahhh… this is the life.
speaker_kaisa: Only thing that would make it better would be…
speaker_umi: [Knowing chirp.]
speaker_kaisa: …Yeah. Akali.
speaker_kaisa: Ever since we became Star Guardians, we haven’t really had a chance to relax.
speaker_kaisa: Even though she begs for breaks all the time. Ugh, what am I doing? Why can’t I just be normal sometimes?
speaker_kaisa: I guess somewhere along the line, I forgot how to be… me. The me before I took the oath.
speaker_umi: [Wise chirps.]
speaker_kaisa: Yeah. You’re right. I can’t lose sight of what’s important—friends to rely on when the fighting ends.
speaker_kaisa: …I’m sure it’ll end. One day. It has to.
speaker_umi: [Hungry chirp.]
speaker_kaisa: Haha! And good ramen is important, too. How could I forget?
speaker_kaisa: Yeah… a nice, big meal… to share with a friend…

Sona Act 1
----------
speaker_school_bell: [RING RONG RING RONG. DING DONG DING DONG.]
speaker_akali: Kai’Sa, is she here?
speaker_kaisa: Nope. Late again.
speaker_kaisa: [The school year just started…]
speaker_kaisa: [...but Sona’s already shown up late to most of her classes.]
speaker_akali: Eventually, Professor Chuba will notice.
speaker_prof_chuba: Settle down, class.
speaker_sona: …
speaker_kaisa: Not today, he won’t.
speaker_kaisa: She’s so quiet… How does she manage to move without making any noise?
speaker_akali: This is ridiculous! I trained for so long, and Sona’s naturally that stealthy? UGH!
speaker_kaisa: Do I sense jealousy, Akali?
speaker_akali: I could sneak past any teacher if I wanted.
speaker_akali: I just prefer to arrive on time.
speaker_prof_chuba: Ahem.
speaker_kaisa: Maybe you’d be better at sneaking if you learned to be quiet every once in a while.
speaker_akali: Maybe bleh bleh blergh.
speaker_prof_chuba: Yesterday, we left off talking about the different types of chemical bonds.
speaker_prof_chuba: Can anyone tell me what a covalent bond is?
speaker_prof_chuba: How about Kai’Sa?
speaker_kaisa: [Ulp! You have got to be kidding me!]
	[Option 1] A type of chemical bond.
	speaker_prof_chuba: I mean… yes. That’s technically correct.
	speaker_kaisa: [Yes!]
	speaker_prof_chuba: But not the answer I was looking for.
	speaker_kaisa: [No!]
	[Option 2] I think Akali knows this one.
	speaker_prof_chuba: Very well. Akali?
	speaker_akali: I… uh…
	speaker_akali: No idea.
	speaker_prof_chuba: Hmm… I thought so.
	[Option 3] How about no?
	speaker_prof_chuba: Are you saying you don’t know the answer?
	speaker_kaisa: …No.
	speaker_prof_chuba: No, you don’t know the answer? Or no, you know the answer?
	speaker_kaisa: I invoke my right to an attorney.
speaker_prof_chuba: …A covalent bond is when two atoms share electrons.
speaker_prof_chuba: It’s my personal favorite bond. Aside from my bond with Mrs. Chuba!
speaker_students: ...
speaker_prof_chuba: A little teacher humor there. Anybody? No? Well, moving on…
----------
speaker_kaisa: Okay, I mean, sure, his speech was cheesy, but the professor did sort of make me realize something.
speaker_akali: Inertia is a property of matter?
speaker_kaisa: Inertia is the… Were we at the same lecture?
speaker_akali: Nope. I was on my phone. They added new levels in Hyper Crystal Dungeon Mobile.
speaker_kaisa: I need to get to know Sona better.
speaker_akali: How did you get that from a science class?
speaker_kaisa: Working together, combining the best parts of a thing to make an even more powerful whole.
speaker_kaisa: It’s just like being Star Guardians.
speaker_akali: This again. So now you’re using chemistry as an excuse to hang out with your team?
speaker_kaisa: Exactly.
speaker_akali: Okay, but why Sona and not, for instance, me?
speaker_kaisa: I already know you too well.
speaker_akali: Hmph. I guess that’s fair.
speaker_kaisa: Oh! Here she comes! I’ll, uh… talk to you later!
speaker_akali: Oh… Bye, I guess?
speaker_kaisa: Sona!
speaker_sona: [Sona waves politely.]
speaker_kaisa: [Oh, great… now what?]
	[Option 1] How’s it hanging?
	[Option 2] What did you think of the lecture?
	[Option 3] Nice, uh… weather we’re having?
speaker_sona: [Sona rotates her wrist rapidly back and forth.]
speaker_kaisa: Does that mean so-so?
speaker_sona: [Sona nods.]
speaker_kaisa: Nice! We are in agreement… I think!
speaker_kaisa: By the way… Akali and I noticed that you’ve been late to class a couple times.
speaker_kaisa: It’s not a huge deal. As long as you aren’t late to our battles against the forces of darkness.
speaker_sona: [Sona shakes her head.]
speaker_kaisa: Cool, cool.
speaker_kaisa: Well, if you want to, erm… tell me about it—what’s going on—I’m here.
speaker_sona: [Sona signs something.]
speaker_kaisa: [Oh, shoot. I don’t know sign language!]
speaker_chiizu: It’s the people, Miss Kai’Sa. They’re running around like mice in a maze!
speaker_kaisa: Chiizu?! You shouldn’t be here! You’ll give us away!
speaker_chiizu: I’ve been here every day! To most non-guardians, I’m invisible unless they know what they’re looking for. Nobody can see me!
speaker_chiizu: Not even you, Miss Kai’Sa! …Except for right now. When you can. Because we’re talking.
speaker_kaisa: Interesting. Must be why nobody ever mentions the other familiars…
speaker_chiizu: But you’re right. It’s too dangerous for me to be talking here… If anyone notices, they might focus on me. And that would blow our cover!
speaker_chiizu: Meet Miss Sona and I at the mall. We’ll explain everything.
speaker_sona: ...
speaker_chiizu: And by we, I of course mean… she! She will explain everything! I’m just a humble translator!
speaker_chiizu: I gotta get outta here! Squeak!
speaker_kaisa: Oh. Well, I guess I’ll meet you two… later, then? Please don’t kill each other?
speaker_sona: [Sona waves goodbye, then turns angrily toward Chiizu.]
speaker_chiizu: RUN AWAY! SHE’S BRIMMING WITH RAGE!
speaker_student: Eek!
speaker_another_student: Professor, one of the lab rats escaped!
speaker_a_third_student: Sona was chasing it through the hall! And I think it was wearing… glasses?!
----------
Sona Act 2
----------
speaker_kaisa: [It’s sooooo early.]
speaker_kaisa: [Why would Sona possibly want to meet at the mall now?]
speaker_kaisa: [Half the stores are closed!]
speaker_sona: [Sona waves.]
speaker_kaisa: Oh! Hi, Sona! Good to see you at the… crack of dawn?
speaker_chiizu: Good morning, Miss Kai’Sa!
speaker_kaisa: And hello to you, Chiizu.
speaker_sona: [Sona signs.]
speaker_chiizu: Thank you for meeting us here so early.
speaker_chiizu: I know it may seem strange to you, but there’s a good reason we chose this place!
speaker_sona: ...!
speaker_chiizu: W..what?! There is a good reason! I was just adding that part for clarity!
speaker_kaisa: It’s fine, really! I guess we aren’t here to shop, though…
speaker_sona: [Sona signs.]
speaker_chiizu: "Maybe later! I was actually hoping to find some books for school."
speaker_kaisa: Chiizu… you can read?
speaker_sona: [Sona forms two L shapes with her hands, tracing along the form of her smile.]
speaker_chiizu: Like I said before, I’m simply translating for Miss Sona. I have no use for academic books! They’re heavy, and very painful when thrown!
speaker_kaisa: Right, I always forget you’re basically a magic butler.
speaker_sona: ...
speaker_chiizu: It’s not funny! I’m a powerful magical being from beyond the stars, squeak!
speaker_chiizu: Ahem… We chose this time because the mall is much less crowded.
speaker_chiizu: And less people means less noise. Too much noise drowns out my thoughts.
speaker_kaisa: Drowns out your… What do you mean by that?
speaker_chiizu: It all started one year ago, almost to the day…
----------
speaker_chiizu: When Zoe attacked the city… Miss Sona was there. In one of the residential districts that got hit the hardest.
speaker_chiizu: Right in the center of everything.
speaker_civilian: [Run! Get out of the way! The stars are falling!]
speaker_shop_owner: [Take shelter! Take shelter before… Oh, no!]
speaker_chiizu: The destruction was deafening.
speaker_chiizu: She couldn’t move. She couldn’t breathe.
speaker_chiizu: Miss Sona could only watch as her neighborhood was blasted to rubble.
----------
speaker_sona: [Sona signs.]
speaker_chiizu: “Screams merged with the sounds of the city. The sirens. The blaring horns.”
speaker_chiizu: “I heard terrible things. It still rings in my ears like a dissonant chorus.”
speaker_chiizu: That’s why Miss Sona is always late for class.
speaker_chiizu: She waits for the rush of people to stop. Businessmen at the train station, students at the school. And of course, for the bell to stop ringing.
speaker_kaisa: Sona… I had no idea. I’m so sorry.
speaker_sona: [Sona signs.]
speaker_kaisa: What’s that mean, Chiizu?
speaker_chiizu: Miss Sona says, “I’m a Star Guardian now.”
speaker_chiizu: When she puts on the uniform… everything is easier.
speaker_kaisa: That’s really nice to hear. I’m glad she has you by her side, Chiizu.
speaker_chiizu: Don’t worry, Miss Kai’Sa, I’m not going anywhere! I’m brave and strong, just like Miss Sona!
speaker_mall_mascot: Why hellooooo there!
speaker_chiizu: AHHHHHHHHH!
speaker_mall_mascot: Was that a— ? Hmm… nevermind.
speaker_sona: ...!
speaker_mall_mascot: Hi! My name is Mimi!
speaker_kaisa: Sona, wait!
speaker_kaisa: Right. All the noise must have scared her off.
speaker_kaisa: Uh, well… Nice costume, I guess.
speaker_mall_mascot: Costume? Whatever do you mean?
	[Option 1] You’re clearly wearing a Star Guardian familiar costume.
	speaker_mall_mascot: No… I’m real! As real as the Star Guardians themselves!
	speaker_mall_mascot: Come on, man! You’re ruining it for the kids!
	speaker_kaisa: THE STAR GUARDIANS?!
	speaker_mall_mascot: Okay, don’t overdo it.
	[Option 2] Oh! I mean: looking good, very real familiar.
	speaker_mall_mascot: Hehe! Thank you!
	speaker_kaisa: You’re much bigger than I remember.
	speaker_mall_mascot: Yeah, I had a growth spurt. A normal familiar thing.
	speaker_kaisa: [Yikes. That sounded angry.]
	[Option 3] Not as good as my costume, though… You should see it! Real sparkly.
	speaker_mall_mascot: You have a Star Guardian costume?! I’m so jealous.
	speaker_kaisa: Yeah, it’s no big deal… kinda tight around the haunches.
	speaker_mall_mascot: Bet it’s not as sweaty as this one. Plus, I can’t even take it home!
	speaker_kaisa: Why would you… take it… home? Actually, I don’t want to know.
speaker_mall_mascot: Anywhoooooo…
speaker_mall_mascot: Don’t forget! It’s Skeeball Sunday! Unlimited rounds all day, only at Arcade World!
speaker_kid: Mommy, look! It’s Mimi!
speaker_mall_mascot: Why hellooooo there!
speaker_kaisa: Well that was exciting. Looks like the mall is starting to get crowded.
speaker_sona: [Sona once more forms two Ls, tracing her smile.]
speaker_kaisa: Ha. You can trust me, Sona. If you’re ever feeling… you know, overwhelmed, I’ll do my best to help.
speaker_sona: [Sona nods.]
speaker_gamer: Come on! The arcade’s opening!
speaker_hardcore_gamer: SKEEBALL SUNDAY! LET’S GO!
speaker_kaisa: [Uh-oh. That’s a lot of gamers.]
speaker_kaisa: Sona, it’ll be alright. Just take deep breaths.
speaker_kaisa: [That’s what people say, right?]
speaker_sona: [Sona takes in short, gasping breaths.]
speaker_kaisa: Crap. This isn’t working.
speaker_kaisa: Uh… Sona! Do you hear that?
speaker_sona: ...
speaker_kaisa: Try focusing on just one sound...
	[Option 1] The clang of tokens in the change machine?
	[Option 2] The clunk of skee balls into the pocket?
	[Option 3] The clattering of feet on the hard tile floor?
speaker_sona: [Sona pauses, listening for a second.]
speaker_kaisa: [I think it’s working…]
speaker_gamer: New high score! Take THAT, Omega Cypher!
speaker_skeeball_machine: DING DING DING!
speaker_kaisa: Ugh…!
speaker_sona: ...!
speaker_kaisa: Sona, how can I help?
speaker_sona: [Sona winces, lowering her hands from her ears to sign.]
speaker_kaisa: Where is Chiizu?! Ugh, that stupid mall mascot ruined everything!
speaker_kaisa: Sorry, Sona. I… don’t understand.
speaker_sona: ...
speaker_kaisa: Sona, wait!
speaker_kaisa: We… never got your books.
----------
Sona Act 3
----------
speaker_kaisa: [Okay, so my last attempt to help Sona didn’t go so hot.]
speaker_kaisa: [But now… I’ve got a new plan of attack.]
speaker_monster: SCREECH!
speaker_kaisa: Oh, come on! Now, of all times?!
speaker_kaisa: Sona! Chiizu!
speaker_kaisa: I think we’re going to have to postpone our coffee date. Unless that gross monster likes maid cafes.
speaker_sona: ...
speaker_chiizu: Of course, Miss Kai’Sa. Should we call the other guardians?
speaker_kaisa: Hmm… This thing doesn’t seem like too big a threat. I think we can take it down.
speaker_sona: [Sona signs.]
speaker_chiizu: “I don’t know. He seems pretty big to me.”
speaker_kaisa: Sona, just say the word, and I’ll call them.
speaker_kaisa: But we can do it alone. I’ve watched you train… You’re a lot stronger than you think.
speaker_sona: [Sona signs.]
speaker_chiizu: Miss Sona says, “I’m not so sure.”
speaker_chiizu: …Erm, this may not be the time… what with the monster and all… and I don’t want to editorialize again…
speaker_chiizu: But Miss Kai’sa, there is more to Miss Sona’s story…
----------
speaker_chiizu: During the attack, Miss Sona couldn’t move.
speaker_chiizu: She would have been hurt,or even killed, if not for the bravery of a boy…
speaker_chiizu: Someone no older than us. And not one of the Star Guardians… just a boy, with no extraordinary powers.
speaker_unknown: Look out!
----------
speaker_sona: [Sona signs.]
speaker_chiizu: He… well. If she’d had the light of the First Star then… maybe he wouldn’t have had to save her. And he wouldn’t have been hurt keeping her safe.
speaker_sona: ...
speaker_chiizu: I’m sorry, Miss Sona. I promise I won’t say more if you don’t want me to.
speaker_kaisa: Sona… I’m so sorry. I had no idea. But… just because you didn’t have the power to help him then, doesn’t mean you can’t help others now.
speaker_kaisa: Being a Star Guardian doesn’t make you brave. Being brave is what makes you a Star Guardian.
speaker_sona: ...
speaker_sona: [Sona signs, “Thank you.”]
speaker_kaisa: Oh, I know this one! Hang on, let me try this…
speaker_kaisa: [You’re welcome.]
speaker_sona: ...!
speaker_kaisa: Nailed it. Now… you ready to kick monster butt?
speaker_monster: SCREEEEEECH!
speaker_sona: ...!
speaker_kaisa: Ugh, the air raid siren is going off, too? Come on!
speaker_kaisa: Wait… Sona, I was wrong before!
speaker_kaisa: You shouldn’t try to focus on one sound.
speaker_kaisa: And you shouldn’t try to shut them out, either!
speaker_sona: ...!
speaker_kaisa: You’re a composer, right? Listen to the music of the city!
	[Option 1] That roar… it’s kinda like a cymbal, isn’t it?
	speaker_chiizu: I see, Miss Kai’Sa! It’s all part of a symphony!
	[Option 2] The siren. It’s laying down a steady beat.
	speaker_chiizu: I see, Miss Kai’Sa! It’s all part of a symphony!
	[Option 3] That guy playing the skinny trumpet on the street corner!
	speaker_chiizu: That’s… a clarinet.
	speaker_kaisa: Is it not called the skinny trumpet?! Who told me…? Ekko. I swear, when this is over...
	speaker_chiizu: But I see…! It’s all part of a symphony.
speaker_kaisa: Exactly!
speaker_sona: ...
speaker_kaisa: Is it… working?
speaker_sona: [“I hear it.”]
speaker_kaisa: Good. Use it. Now, let’s mop up that giant freak before the cafe closes.
speaker_monster: SCREeeeechhh!
speaker_monster: SCR... eeeeech...
speaker_kaisa: Huff… huff… piece of cake!
speaker_kaisa: Ugh, I shouldn’t have said that. Burned a lot of calories out there. Now, I want cake.
speaker_sona: ...!
speaker_kaisa: Sona! You killed it! Literally! Your music powers are so strong!
speaker_chiizu: Miss Sona was incredible! She was all, “Bang! Pow! Pow!” And the monster was all, “SCREEEECH!”
speaker_kaisa: Heh. I see you’ve been hanging out with Taliyah.
speaker_chiizu: Chu chu, star powers!
speaker_sona: [“It was a thrilling battle, Captain.”]
speaker_kaisa: [Sign language! And you understand it now! Okay, Kai’Sa… you got this.]
speaker_kaisa: [You’ve been practicing your signs. You’ve done your homework. The moment is perfect. Please don’t screw it up…]
	[Option 1] “You make beautiful music, Sona.”
	speaker_sona: [“You too, Kai’Sa.”]
	speaker_chiizu: Sona is thankful, Miss Kai’Sa.
	speaker_chiizu: Yeah, I know you understood her without me! But I’m not giving up my job! This economy is brutal!
	[Option 2] “We should start a band. I can play the triangle!”
	speaker_sona: [“My music is more of a solo act.”]
	speaker_chiizu: Sona… will think about it, Miss Kai’Sa.
	speaker_chiizu: See? That was interpreting for extra politeness. I’m also learning things!
	[Option 3] “Let’s get out of here before they make us clean this up.”
	speaker_sona: [Sona signs, “But we should help.”]
	speaker_chiizu: Sona would like to stay. For a little while.
	speaker_chiizu: At least until people start to gather. Our cover can’t be blown yet, squeak!
speaker_kaisa: I’ll just have to take your word for it, Chiizu.
speaker_chiizu: I’m impressed, Miss Kai’Sa. Your sign language has greatly improved!
speaker_kaisa: A captain’s got to be able to communicate with her team.
speaker_kaisa: [“Right, Sona?”]
speaker_sona: [“Right.”]
speaker_kaisa: I’m here for you. We all are. I know it won’t always be easy…
speaker_kaisa: Some days, you might not be able to handle the crowds.
speaker_kaisa: [“But that’s okay.”]
speaker_kaisa: [“Just take it one… note at a time.”]
speaker_sona: [“You don’t know anything about music, do you?”]
speaker_kaisa: I know about autotune. Does that count?
speaker_sona: [“No, it doesn’t.”]
speaker_kaisa: [“Maybe you can teach me?”]
speaker_sona: [“I’d love that.”]
speaker_chiizu: Ooh! I’ll get my wood block!
speaker_chiizu: Don’t start the lesson without me! The great wood block musician and interpreter extraordinaire, Chiizu! Squeak!
speaker_sona: [Sona signs a laugh.]

Taliyah Act 1
----------
speaker_kaisa: Taliyah?
speaker_kaisa: Taliyah? Did anyone see where Taliyah went?
----------
speaker_kaisa: Taliyah? Hey, are you around here?
speaker_kaisa: Where did she...?
----------
speaker_taliyah: ...
speaker_kaisa: Tali! There you are! I’ve been looking all over for you.
speaker_taliyah: Oh! Captain! I apologize. I didn’t mean to cause you any distress.
speaker_taliyah: What can I help you with? Hopefully nothing too troubling.
speaker_kaisa: Uh… right…
speaker_kaisa: You, uh… left your familiar in class…
speaker_aru: [Beeeehhhh.]
speaker_taliyah: Aru! You silly little thing. Captain, I apologize profusely for Aru’s behavior. Sometimes, they… wander off. I can assure you this won’t happen again.
speaker_aru: [Beehhh.]
speaker_taliyah: I know nobody can see them, but… if you’d like me to run extra training drills as punishment, I fully support your decision!
speaker_kaisa: Um… That… won’t be necessary…
speaker_kaisa: ...
speaker_taliyah: Yes? Is there anything else, Captain?
speaker_kaisa: Nothing, I just… You’re so… different when we’re training… almost like an entirely other person.
speaker_taliyah: Ah, yes, well...! It’s, ah… That is true…
speaker_taliyah: I… er… Well… it’s just that… um…
speaker_kaisa: I-I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to embarrass you! I, uh… Oh, gosh, how do I fix this?
speaker_taliyah: N-no worries! I just think I’d rather tell you… away from school. School is kind of… a related problem.
speaker_kaisa: Got it! In that case…
	[Option 1] How about Arcade World? I’m a crack shot on the VALORANT machine.
	speaker_taliyah: Ah… I don’t know if I should go to Arcade World…
	speaker_kaisa: Too loud? Sorry, I didn’t mean to…
	speaker_taliyah: Oh, it’s not that. I can get a little… uh… competitive. One time, I told this kid I’d bury his family. It’s… not a great look.
	speaker_taliyah: What about Café Cuties? They have really cute drinks, and everyone there is super nice!
	[Option 2] The park? It’s really beautiful right now, and super quiet.
	speaker_taliyah: Ah… Targon Park? I know the wishing tree is in bloom, but, uh…
	speaker_kaisa: Not a fan of wishes? Or trees?
	speaker_taliyah: No! I mean, yes! I mean… Um, maybe not somewhere outside… At least, not right this minute…
	speaker_taliyah: What about Café Cuties? They have really cute drinks, and everyone there is super nice!
	[Option 3] You don’t like… Café Cuties… do you?
	speaker_taliyah: Ahhh, Café Cuties… I’m one stamp away from winning a special meep teacup. It has little eyes! It looks at me!
	speaker_kaisa: Meep… teacup? I’m not familiar… Café Cuties isn’t exactly my kind of…
	speaker_taliyah: It’s decided! Café Cuties it is!
	speaker_kaisa: Oh, man… a maid café? This is gonna be so awkward…
speaker_taliyah: Don’t worry, it’s not that awkward. You just have to… lean into the fantasy.
speaker_taliyah: You go on ahead, Captain! I need to get changed before I meet you.
speaker_kaisa: Yeah, of course—
speaker_kaisa: Wait. What do you mean, “get changed”...?
----------
speaker_kaisa: What is this menu? “Cutie Puffs with an Extra Special Smooch, Just For You?” “Cutie Coffee with a Dollop of Clouds?”
speaker_kaisa: Oh, no! All the items have little characters. “Café Cuties Vladimir offers you a cup of his finest tea, but watch out for his evil nephew…”
speaker_kaisa: The cute little tea guy has an evil nephew? Is… is there an expanded Café Cuties universe? There’s, like, fifteen characters! What is happening?!
speaker_kaisa: Maybe I died on the walk over. Maybe I’m trapped here. I sinned in life, and Café Cuties is my purgatory.
speaker_taliyah: Hey, be nice! I really like this place!
speaker_kaisa: Tali! I’m so glad you’re here! This pla… ce…
speaker_taliyah: This place what?
speaker_kaisa: Isn’t what I… expected…
speaker_taliyah: …Hmm? Is there something on my face?
----------
speaker_taliyah: Hang on… Okay, did I wipe it off? Captain? Did I get it?
----------
Taliyah Act 2
----------
speaker_kaisa: You think you can take me down?! Not today, First Year!
----------
speaker_kaisa: I’m the captain for a reason, Tali! And you just let your guard down!
speaker_kaisa: A rookie mistake, one I’ll make you pay for! Rain of Starlight!
speaker_kaisa: Huff… huff… Gotcha.
speaker_kaisa: Wait… Where’d she…?
speaker_taliyah: I let my guard down, huh?! More like you’re the captain of sucking, ha!
speaker_kaisa: This… This isn’t over!
speaker_taliyah: I think it is! You just used all your energy for your special attack, while I’ve been dodging everything you throw at me!
speaker_kaisa: No way...! I can still...!
	[Option 1] You may defeat me here, but I’ll be back! And next time, I’ll be stronger than ever!
	[Option 2] Enjoy your momentary victory, Star Guardian! Though I fall here, my allies will follow!
	[Option 3] If you destroy me with the power of friendship, I will sock your freaking nose.
speaker_taliyah: Nice speech, Captain. Now, get ready to ride the pain train!
speaker_taliyah: Chu chu! Star Volley!
speaker_kaisa: I’ll get you for thiiiiiiiis!
----------
speaker_kaisa: Ow, ow… Can someone help me drink my Macha-Kun Lovely Latte? Or give me my Special Smooch Just For Me? I’m in quite a lot of pain…
speaker_taliyah: I-I’m so sorry, Captain! I truly didn’t mean to hit you so hard!
speaker_kaisa: Ouch… ugh… It’s totally fine… Good to see you’re… ow, ow, ow… taking to the training…
speaker_kaisa: Whew, you weren’t kidding about the pain train. That really smarts.
speaker_taliyah: Also… I think the special smooch is just a sticker.
speaker_kaisa: Ugh… Foiled again… Just like Viego trying to get to his uncle Vladimir’s exotic teas…
speaker_taliyah: Soooo, I guess you like this place now, huh?
speaker_kaisa: It grows on you.
speaker_kaisa: Also, they did Café Cuties Viego dirty! Sealing him in a prison of crystal tea?! All he wanted was to use the power of the hibiscus fragments to free his wife from the clutches of Earl Grey!
speaker_kaisa: Ahem. I’m not fangirling. I’m just… passionate about tea. Let’s change the subject.
speaker_kaisa: What happens to you out in the field, Tali? At school, you avoid almost everyone, and you’re super polite… Here, you’re, well… It looks like you work on a crabbing ship.
speaker_taliyah: Haha… Yeah, I guess it’s a little confusing.
speaker_taliyah: Truth be told… It's the school uniforms.
speaker_kaisa: Wait… the ones we have to wear? Like, with the skirts and the blazers? The one I’m wearing right now?
speaker_taliyah: Yeah, those ones.
speaker_taliyah: They’re not really… hm… my style, I guess. So I don’t really like being seen in them. Anywhere.
speaker_kaisa: Of course! That’s why you get changed before we hang out!
speaker_taliyah: Right, exactly! I dunno. I don’t like the way those uniforms look on me. They aren’t very… pretty. O-on me! You look fine!
speaker_taliyah: Now that I’m in high school, I’ve been trying to figure out my own sense of style… but…
speaker_kaisa: We’re always training.
speaker_taliyah: Yeah… Sorry, Captain. I know how much you like training… and being a Star Guardian…
speaker_taliyah: I like it, too! But… hmm… after the invasion, I spent a lot of time helping my family rebuild. We live by the shops, and a lot of the buildings were badly damaged in the attack.
speaker_taliyah: I was going through a lot back then… N-not that everyone else wasn’t! But I felt like I had to put my problems on hold.
speaker_taliyah: Then I met you and Akali, I took the oath, and we all started training… Then school started up again… It all happened so fast…
speaker_taliyah: Until I can figure out the way I want to dress, I’d rather wear this big hoodie. Then I can make my, you know, fashion debut… without anyone telling me how I should dress.
speaker_taliyah: I-if that makes sense!
speaker_kaisa: Huh… a fashion problem. You’re so confident as a Star Guardian… I never would have guessed.
speaker_taliyah: Like I said, the Star Guardian outfit makes me feel like the person I want to be! If I can find some clothes like that… Well, maybe without the magical space powers…
speaker_taliyah: I’m sure I could throw this ratty old hoodie away for good!
speaker_taliyah: Uh… and maybe be more confident… at school. A-and other places. Here. The park. Etcetera.
speaker_kaisa: Interesting…
speaker_kaisa: Well, as your captain, I’d love to help! Only if you’ll let me, of course.
speaker_taliyah: You’re more than my captain, Cap… uh, Kai’Sa. We’re friends! I-I think!
speaker_taliyah: Though, uh… you’re not exactly the most… um…
speaker_taliyah: Fashionable? Person?
speaker_taliyah: Please, don’t be mad!
	[Option 1] I do wear this uniform a lot…
	speaker_taliyah: A-and there’s nothing wrong with that, Captain!
	speaker_taliyah: But, you know, it’s not for me.
	[Option 2] There’s nothing wrong with student-body-president/fit-girlboss casual, Tali.
	speaker_taliyah: I’ve been reading a lot of fashion magazines… and I don’t think that’s a thing.
	speaker_kaisa: It could be a thing.
	speaker_taliyah: Well...
	[Option 3] I have just become fully evil. I am now your archnemesis.
	speaker_taliyah: C-Captain! No!
	speaker_kaisa: I’m going to build a giant, evil castle. With spikes. It’ll be awesome, and you can’t hang out in it.
	speaker_taliyah: Oh… you’re joking. Whew.
speaker_kaisa: Hmm. You know who’s really on top of fashion trends? Akali.
speaker_taliyah: Really?!
speaker_taliyah: Oh… but are you two alright? You both seem… strained?
speaker_kaisa: Ugh... I don’t know. I think we’re okay? It’s… complicated.
speaker_kaisa: Regardless! She really likes you, so she’ll totally help update your look!
speaker_taliyah: Really?! Oh, Captain, that’s amazing! Thank you!
speaker_kaisa: Of course, Tali! You’re my—
speaker_kaisa: Ow, ow, ow, my back. My sides. My legs. My head. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…
speaker_taliyah: Argh! I’m really, really sorry! I never should have made you ride the pain train!
speaker_kaisa: Café Cuties Bard… take me away…
----------
Taliyah Act 3
----------
speaker_taliyah: Uh… I dunno about this one…
speaker_kaisa: I think it looks nice.
speaker_akali: You’re not looking with a critical eye. You want to accentuate the hips and waistline while drawing the eye across the midsection.
speaker_kaisa: I don’t know what that means.
speaker_akali: Kai, I love you. You know I do. Now get out of this dressing room right now before I stab you.
speaker_kaisa: Ugh! Fine!
speaker_aru: [Baaaah.]
speaker_kaisa: You, too, Aru?
speaker_aru: [Behhh.]
speaker_kaisa: Well, that’s your fault. Just because you can pull off a bucket hat, doesn’t mean everyone can!
speaker_aru: [Bleeeeeehhh.]
speaker_kaisa: And what’s so bad about jeggings?! They’re for work and for play!
speaker_aru: [Baaaabaaah.]
speaker_kaisa: Whatever. Stupid alpaca. Telling me what to do. You don’t even have hands.
speaker_akali: Welp. No dice.
speaker_taliyah: Sorry, everyone! I don’t mean to be a bother!
speaker_aru: [Beeeehhh.]
speaker_akali: Thank you, Aru! That’s a very good point!
speaker_akali: We may not know what works, but we did find out what doesn’t work. That means we’re getting close.
speaker_taliyah: Really?!
speaker_kaisa: Yeah, wait, really?
speaker_akali: Kai, I wouldn’t expect you to know this because your personal fashion is whatever the rules say is mandatory…
speaker_kaisa: Hmph. At least it’s functional.
speaker_akali: But Taliyah requires a deft, and fashionable, hand. Process of elimination is still a process. I’m pretty sure you told me that in a very boring speech about something.
	[Option 1] The mathematics of magical artillery is not boring!
	[Option 2] Let’s see how you like it when the enemy switches to mixed-infantry tactics.
	[Option 3] Better hope we never fight alternate versions of ourselves sent by an evil corporation.
speaker_akali: BOO! NOT FUN!
speaker_akali: And I only say that because I love you.
speaker_kaisa: Ugh, fine. I’ll give you a pass.
speaker_akali: Thatta girl. Now… Taliyah.
speaker_taliyah: !!!
speaker_akali: Hmm… I have some ideas. Stick here with Kai while I grab some stuff from different stores.
speaker_kaisa: You’re not gonna shoplift, are you?!
speaker_akali: Oh, what’s that? I need Aru’s help for an undisclosed reason? Come on, little buddy. Let’s make some magic happen.
speaker_aru: [Beehhhh.]
speaker_kaisa: Akali! Don’t steal!
speaker_kaisa: Ugh… My dad’s gonna kill me…
speaker_taliyah: Heh heh. You two are funny.
speaker_kaisa: …We are. We’re pretty funny.
speaker_taliyah: I hope this works… I would love to find something I can wear that isn’t, you know, gonna blow our cover and reveal our secret identities to the world.
speaker_taliyah: N-no pressure though!
speaker_kaisa: Don’t worry about that right now. Akali has… unconventional methods… but I bet she’ll know what to do.
speaker_taliyah: I just wanna figure out my own look. It feels so frustrating… This should have been really easy!
speaker_taliyah: Every other girl in school did it! I see you all walking around on the weekends… You all look amazing, while I’m balled up in this big, dumb hoodie.
speaker_kaisa: Dumb? Why’s the hoodie dumb? I thought it was part of the mystique of figuring out your, you know… big fashion debut.
speaker_taliyah: I mean… sure… That’s true…
speaker_taliyah: It’s also one of the only things we saved from our old house.
speaker_kaisa: Oh, Tali… I’m sorry…
speaker_taliyah: N-no, no! It’s not that bad! Everybody came together in our neighborhood and built it all back a hundred times better!
speaker_taliyah: It just feels like… this hoodie is holding me back in that time...
speaker_taliyah: Like… I can’t move on. I know, it sounds really dumb. But that’s the way I feel.
speaker_taliyah: Have you ever felt like you can’t move on, Captain?
	[Option 1] I lost someone close, once.
	speaker_kaisa: My mom passing was pretty tough. I still think about it sometimes.
	speaker_taliyah: I-I’m sorry! I didn’t know!
	speaker_kaisa: It’s alright. It happened a long time ago. I was really young.
	speaker_kaisa: Part of it… never goes away. You learn to cope.
	[Option 2] The night of the invasion. I keep seeing it in my dreams.
	speaker_taliyah: Seems like that night hit everybody pretty hard.
	speaker_kaisa: I was there, Tali. At the epicenter… right in the middle of the battle.
	speaker_taliyah: Oh...
	speaker_kaisa: It feels like I’m still there sometimes. I hope, one day, that changes.
	[Option 3] How could they do that to Viego?! Of all the Café Cuties, why him?!
	speaker_kaisa: It’s not fair! He just wants to be with his wife!
	speaker_taliyah: M-maybe you’ve been getting too into the Café Cuties canon…
	speaker_kaisa: It doesn’t make any sense! If Bard has the cosmic power of brewing the perfect cup of tea, why can’t Vladimir just give Viego the magical hibiscus fragments?!
	speaker_kaisa: Taliyah, you have made me this way, and that is why we are enemies. I cherish your friendship. We are enemies.
speaker_taliyah: S-seems like we both have some ghosts.
speaker_kaisa: Yeah, maybe.
speaker_kaisa: But we’ll figure it out together.
speaker_taliyah: Yeah!
speaker_akali: RUN!
speaker_akali: Hello! We need to go right now! I may have gone overboard!
speaker_security: Hey! Someone stop that girl and her weird, tall dog!
speaker_kaisa: We can talk about this later! Book it!
----------
speaker_narrator: ...
----------
speaker_taliyah: Well? What do you bad dudes think?
speaker_taliyah: I think I look hot. But approachable. Also, I could kick a monster off the top of a skyscraper. Star kick! Chu chu!
speaker_akali: There she is. That’s the Taliyah I know.
speaker_kaisa: Glad you found your look, Tali. Wanna wear it out? Maybe kick a villain off a skyscraper?
speaker_taliyah: Soon, all will be revealed! But not yet. I wanna save it for the exact right moment.
speaker_taliyah: Alright, hoodie, looks like you and I are gonna do one last big score before retirement. Yee-haw!
speaker_taliyah: Oh, wow. The tag says these leggings are… oh, wow.
speaker_kaisa: Kali, how much did these clothes cost?
speaker_akali: They were free. Shut up.
speaker_kaisa: Those are crazy-expensive designer brands. What did you do?!
speaker_akali: I did what had to be done, O Great and Mighty Captain.
speaker_akali: Also, I may be banned from the bottom floor of the mall until their security team retires. No big deal.
speaker_kaisa: We’ll talk about this later.
speaker_taliyah: Aaaaand I’m back. What were you two talking about? Doing crimes?
speaker_kaisa: Tali! You’re in your academy outfit?!
speaker_akali: I thought you hated that thing?!
speaker_taliyah: Yeah, I did. But after seeing myself in my awesome new outfit…
speaker_taliyah: ...I realized maybe it’s not the clothes holding me back. It’s just me. But now… I feel really good.
speaker_taliyah: I know I can look cute and kick butt. I wasn’t so sure before… but even having one look set aside really makes a difference.
speaker_taliyah: Thanks, to both of you. I really mean it.
speaker_taliyah: I still hate these stupid outfits, though. When we graduate, let's burn them.
speaker_akali: New best friend. Kai’Sa, you’re demoted.
speaker_kaisa: Taliyah… Here's your gun and badge. Respect the code of the best friend, and please promise not to commit any more mall crimes.
----------
speaker_taliyah: I will literally only do mall crimes.
