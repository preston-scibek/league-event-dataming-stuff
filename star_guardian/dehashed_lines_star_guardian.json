    "taliyah_1_scene_240a_30_text": "Oh, it’s not that. I can get a little… uh… competitive. One time, I told this kid I’d bury his family. It’s… not a great look.",

    "kaisa_2_scene_760c_40_text": "Relax, Kai’Sa. If not for yourself… for them.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_10_text": "You think you can take me down?! Not today, First Year!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_20_text": "I’m the captain for a reason, Tali! And you just let your guard down!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_30_text": "A rookie mistake, one I’ll make you pay for! Rain of Starlight!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_40_text": "Huff… huff… Gotcha.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_50_text": "Wait… Where’d she…?",
    "taliyah_2_scene_60_text": "I let my guard down, huh?! More like you’re the captain of sucking, ha!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_70_text": "This… This isn’t over!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_80_text": "I think it is! You just used all your energy for your special attack, while I’ve been dodging everything you throw at me!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_90_text": "No way...! I can still...!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_90_responseA": "You may defeat me here, but I’ll be back! And next time, I’ll be stronger than ever!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_90_responseB": "Enjoy your momentary victory, Star Guardian! Though I fall here, my allies will follow!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_90_responseC": "If you destroy me with the power of friendship, I will sock your freaking nose.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_100_text": "Nice speech, Captain. Now, get ready to ride the pain train!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_110_text": "Chu chu! Star Volley!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_120_text": "I’ll get you for thiiiiiiiis!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_130_text": "Ow, ow… Can someone help me drink my Macha-Kun Lovely Latte? Or give me my Special Smooch Just For Me? I’m in quite a lot of pain…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_140_text": "I-I’m so sorry, Captain! I truly didn’t mean to hit you so hard!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_150_text": "Ouch… ugh… It’s totally fine… Good to see you’re… ow, ow, ow… taking to the training…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_160_text": "Whew, you weren’t kidding about the pain train. That really smarts.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_170_text": "Also… I think the special smooch is just a sticker.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_180_text": "Ugh… Foiled again… Just like Viego trying to get to his uncle Vladimir’s exotic teas…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_200_text": "Soooo, I guess you like this place now, huh?",
    "taliyah_2_scene_210_text": "It grows on you.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_220_text": "Also, they did Café Cuties Viego dirty! Sealing him in a prison of crystal tea?! All he wanted was to use the power of the hibiscus fragments to free his wife from the clutches of Earl Grey!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_230_text": "Ahem. I’m not fangirling. I’m just… passionate about tea. Let’s change the subject.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_240_text": "What happens to you out in the field, Tali? At school, you avoid almost everyone, and you’re super polite… Here, you’re, well… It looks like you work on a crabbing ship.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_250_text": "Haha… Yeah, I guess it’s a little confusing.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_260_text": "Truth be told… It's the school uniforms.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_270_text": "Wait… the ones we have to wear? Like, with the skirts and the blazers? The one I’m wearing right now?",
    "taliyah_2_scene_280_text": "Yeah, those ones.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_290_text": "They’re not really… hm… my style, I guess. So I don’t really like being seen in them. Anywhere.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_300_text": "Of course! That’s why you get changed before we hang out!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_310_text": "Right, exactly! I dunno. I don’t like the way those uniforms look on me. They aren’t very… pretty. O-on me! You look fine!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_320_text": "Now that I’m in high school, I’ve been trying to figure out my own sense of style… but…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_330_text": "We’re always training.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_340_text": "Yeah… Sorry, Captain. I know how much you like training… and being a Star Guardian…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_350_text": "I like it, too! But… hmm… after the invasion, I spent a lot of time helping my family rebuild. We live by the shops, and a lot of the buildings were badly damaged in the attack.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_360_text": "I was going through a lot back then… N-not that everyone else wasn’t! But I felt like I had to put my problems on hold.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_370_text": "Then I met you and Akali, I took the oath, and we all started training… Then school started up again… It all happened so fast…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_380_text": "Until I can figure out the way I want to dress, I’d rather wear this big hoodie. Then I can make my, you know, fashion debut… without anyone telling me how I should dress.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_390_text": "I-if that makes sense!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_400_text": "Huh… a fashion problem. You’re so confident as a Star Guardian… I never would have guessed.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_410_text": "Like I said, the Star Guardian outfit makes me feel like the person I want to be! If I can find some clothes like that… Well, maybe without the magical space powers…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_420_text": "I’m sure I could throw this ratty old hoodie away for good!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_430_text": "Uh… and maybe be more confident… at school. A-and other places. Here. The park. Etcetera.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_440_text": "Interesting…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_450_text": "Well, as your captain, I’d love to help! Only if you’ll let me, of course.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_460_text": "You’re more than my captain, Cap… uh, Kai’Sa. We’re friends! I-I think!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_470_text": "Though, uh… you’re not exactly the most… um…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_480_text": "Fashionable? Person?",
    "taliyah_2_scene_490_text": "Please, don’t be mad!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_490_responseA": "I do wear this uniform a lot…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_490_responseB": "There’s nothing wrong with student-body-president/fit-girlboss casual, Tali.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_490_responseC": "I have just become fully evil. I am now your archnemesis.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_510_text": "Hmm. You know who’s really on top of fashion trends? Akali.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_520_text": "Really?!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_530_text": "Oh… but are you two alright? You both seem… strained?",
    "taliyah_2_scene_540_text": "Ugh... I don’t know. I think we’re okay? It’s… complicated.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_550_text": "Regardless! She really likes you, so she’ll totally help update your look!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_560_text": "Really?! Oh, Captain, that’s amazing! Thank you!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_570_text": "Of course, Tali! You’re my—",
    "taliyah_2_scene_580_text": "Ow, ow, ow, my back. My sides. My legs. My head. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_590_text": "Argh! I’m really, really sorry! I never should have made you ride the pain train!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_600_text": "Café Cuties Bard… take me away…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500a_10_text": "A-and there’s nothing wrong with that, Captain!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500a_20_text": "But, you know, it’s not for me.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500b_10_text": "I’ve been reading a lot of fashion magazines… and I don’t think that’s a thing.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500b_20_text": "It could be a thing.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500b_30_text": "Well...",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500c_10_text": "C-Captain! No!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500c_20_text": "I’m going to build a giant, evil castle. With spikes. It’ll be awesome, and you can’t hang out in it.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500c_30_text": "Oh… you’re joking. Whew.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_10_text": "Uh… I dunno about this one…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_20_text": "I think it looks nice.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_30_text": "You’re not looking with a critical eye. You want to accentuate the hips and waistline while drawing the eye across the midsection.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_40_text": "I don’t know what that means.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_50_text": "Kai, I love you. You know I do. Now get out of this dressing room right now before I stab you.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_60_text": "Ugh! Fine!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_70_text": "[Baaaah.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_80_text": "You, too, Aru?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_90_text": "[Behhh.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_100_text": "Well, that’s your fault. Just because you can pull off a bucket hat, doesn’t mean everyone can!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_110_text": "[Bleeeeeehhh.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_120_text": "And what’s so bad about jeggings?! They’re for work and for play!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_130_text": "[Baaaabaaah.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_140_text": "Whatever. Stupid alpaca. Telling me what to do. You don’t even have hands.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_150_text": "Welp. No dice.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_160_text": "Sorry, everyone! I don’t mean to be a bother!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_170_text": "[Beeeehhh.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_180_text": "Thank you, Aru! That’s a very good point!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_190_text": "We may not know what works, but we did find out what doesn’t work. That means we’re getting close.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_200_text": "Really?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_210_text": "Yeah, wait, really?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_220_text": "Kai, I wouldn’t expect you to know this because your personal fashion is whatever the rules say is mandatory…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_230_text": "Hmph. At least it’s functional.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_240_text": "But Taliyah requires a deft, and fashionable, hand. Process of elimination is still a process. I’m pretty sure you told me that in a very boring speech about something.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_240_responseA": "The mathematics of magical artillery is not boring!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_240_responseB": "Let’s see how you like it when the enemy switches to mixed-infantry tactics.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_240_responseC": "Better hope we never fight alternate versions of ourselves sent by an evil corporation.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_250_text": "BOO! NOT FUN!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_260_text": "And I only say that because I love you.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_270_text": "Ugh, fine. I’ll give you a pass.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_280_text": "Thatta girl. Now… Taliyah.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_290_text": "!!!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_300_text": "Hmm… I have some ideas. Stick here with Kai while I grab some stuff from different stores.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_310_text": "You’re not gonna shoplift, are you?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_320_text": "Oh, what’s that? I need Aru’s help for an undisclosed reason? Come on, little buddy. Let’s make some magic happen.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_330_text": "[Beehhhh.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_340_text": "Akali! Don’t steal!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_350_text": "Ugh… My dad’s gonna kill me…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_360_text": "Heh heh. You two are funny.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_370_text": "…We are. We’re pretty funny.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_380_text": "I hope this works… I would love to find something I can wear that isn’t, you know, gonna blow our cover and reveal our secret identities to the world.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_390_text": "N-no pressure though!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_400_text": "Don’t worry about that right now. Akali has… unconventional methods… but I bet she’ll know what to do.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_410_text": "I just wanna figure out my own look. It feels so frustrating… This should have been really easy!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_420_text": "Every other girl in school did it! I see you all walking around on the weekends… You all look amazing, while I’m balled up in this big, dumb hoodie.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_430_text": "Dumb? Why’s the hoodie dumb? I thought it was part of the mystique of figuring out your, you know… big fashion debut.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_440_text": "I mean… sure… That’s true…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_450_text": "It’s also one of the only things we saved from our old house.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_460_text": "Oh, Tali… I’m sorry…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_470_text": "N-no, no! It’s not that bad! Everybody came together in our neighborhood and built it all back a hundred times better!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_480_text": "It just feels like… this hoodie is holding me back in that time...",
    "taliyah_3_scene_490_text": "Like… I can’t move on. I know, it sounds really dumb. But that’s the way I feel.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_500_text": "Have you ever felt like you can’t move on, Captain?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_500_responseA": "I lost someone close, once.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_500_responseB": "The night of the invasion. I keep seeing it in my dreams.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_500_responseC": "How could they do that to Viego?! Of all the Café Cuties, why him?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_520_text": "S-seems like we both have some ghosts.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_530_text": "Yeah, maybe.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_540_text": "But we’ll figure it out together.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_550_text": "Yeah!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_560_text": "RUN!",

    "taliyah_3_scene_610_text": "Well? What do you bad dudes think?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_620_text": "I think I look hot. But approachable. Also, I could kick a monster off the top of a skyscraper. Star kick! Chu chu!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_630_text": "There she is. That’s the Taliyah I know.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_640_text": "Glad you found your look, Tali. Wanna wear it out? Maybe kick a villain off a skyscraper?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_650_text": "Soon, all will be revealed! But not yet. I wanna save it for the exact right moment.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_660_text": "Alright, hoodie, looks like you and I are gonna do one last big score before retirement. Yee-haw!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_670_text": "Oh, wow. The tag says these leggings are… oh, wow.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_680_text": "Kali, how much did these clothes cost?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_690_text": "They were free. Shut up.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_700_text": "Those are crazy-expensive designer brands. What did you do?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_710_text": "I did what had to be done, O Great and Mighty Captain.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_720_text": "Also, I may be banned from the bottom floor of the mall until their security team retires. No big deal.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_730_text": "We’ll talk about this later.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_740_text": "Aaaaand I’m back. What were you two talking about? Doing crimes?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_750_text": "Tali! You’re in your academy outfit?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_760_text": "I thought you hated that thing?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_770_text": "Yeah, I did. But after seeing myself in my awesome new outfit…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_780_text": "...I realized maybe it’s not the clothes holding me back. It’s just me. But now… I feel really good.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_790_text": "I know I can look cute and kick butt. I wasn’t so sure before… but even having one look set aside really makes a difference.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_800_text": "Thanks, to both of you. I really mean it.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_810_text": "I still hate these stupid outfits, though. When we graduate, let's burn them.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_820_text": "New best friend. Kai’Sa, you’re demoted.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_830_text": "Taliyah… Here's your gun and badge. Respect the code of the best friend, and please promise not to commit any more mall crimes.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_840_text": "I will literally only do mall crimes.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_510a_10_text": "My mom passing was pretty tough. I still think about it sometimes.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_510a_20_text": "I-I’m sorry! I didn’t know!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_510a_30_text": "It’s alright. It happened a long time ago. I was really young.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_510a_40_text": "Part of it… never goes away. You learn to cope.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_510b_10_text": "Seems like that night hit everybody pretty hard.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_510b_20_text": "I was there, Tali. At the epicenter… right in the middle of the battle.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_510b_30_text": "Oh...",
    "taliyah_3_scene_510b_40_text": "It feels like I’m still there sometimes. I hope, one day, that changes.",

    "akali_3_scene_130_text": "A lot of ramen.",
    "akali_3_scene_140_text": "You know, she always finds a way to make me laugh. Your friend is very funny.",
    "akali_3_scene_150_text": "She talks with you?",
    "akali_3_scene_160_text": "Oh, sometimes. Other times, she just eats in silence. Tends to be the case with all my customers.",
    "akali_3_scene_170_text": "But she’ll make this funny face when she’s slurping noodles. Always cracks me up.",
    "akali_3_scene_180_text": "I know the one. So focused. Like if she lets a single noodle slip from her mouth…",
    "akali_3_scene_190_text": "The world will end. Gyah hah!",
    "akali_3_scene_200_text": "What... what does she say? When you talk?",
    "akali_3_scene_210_text": "Don’t worry. She doesn’t spill any of your exciting teenager secrets, whatever they are. Plays a lot of Hyper Crystal Something-or-Other on her phone.",
    "akali_3_scene_220_text": "She talks a lot about the future. Or… hm… the lack of it. Not as uncommon as you’d think for someone her age. When you’re young, you don’t have much for reference.",
    "akali_3_scene_230_text": "One bad thing becomes… the only thing, because there’s nothing else to compare it to. She’s real vague about whatever it is. Not that it’s any of my business.",

    "akali_3_scene_250_text": "When did I become a person she couldn’t talk to…?",

    "akali_3_scene_290_text": "…We do?",
    "akali_3_scene_300_text": "Of course! Akali mentioned you’re the leader of your—what was it—ah! Tennis team.",
    "akali_3_scene_310_text": "Balancing that with school… can’t be easy. I never played tennis, but, you know. I assume.",
    "akali_3_scene_320_text": "On the other hand, I am an old cook with an abundance of time.",
    "akali_3_scene_330_text": "I am the empty-handed man. Her problems are the—",
    "akali_3_scene_340_text": "The stones. I get it. And I have my own stones?",
    "akali_3_scene_350_text": "We all do.",
    "akali_3_scene_360_text": "You just travel with her down that road. Carry your stones together, and I’m sure she’ll come around.",

    "akali_3_scene_400_responseB": "Uh… No, I just happened to be walking by…",
    "akali_3_scene_400_responseC": "This is sort of where I hang out, so technically, you’re stalking me…",
    "akali_3_scene_410_text": "…I was joking.",
    "akali_3_scene_420_text": "Oh. Yeah. I know.",
    "akali_3_scene_430_text": "Seriously though, how’d you find me?",
    "akali_3_scene_440_text": "Well, you’re not exactly hiding…",
    "akali_3_scene_450_text": "Also the guys at the arcade said you threw a skeeball so hard it broke the machine, then stormed off to “that stupid statue.”",
    "akali_3_scene_460_text": "Threw it overhand. Like in the major leagues.",
    "akali_3_scene_470_text": "...",
    "akali_3_scene_480_text": "So… what? Am I late for training or something?",
    "akali_3_scene_490_text": "Sorry, no, nothing like that. We… we don’t have to talk about Star Guardian stuff. If you don’t want to.",
    "akali_3_scene_500_text": "Great.",
    "akali_3_scene_510_text": "...",
    "akali_3_scene_520_text": "Though… Do you think they’ll make statues of us one day? You know… if we don’t all, uh, die horribly?",

    "akali_3_scene_520_responseB": "I don’t know. You have to be a pretty big hero to get a statue.",
    "akali_3_scene_520_responseC": "If they do, I hope it’s one where we shoot water out of our mouths.",
    "akali_3_scene_540_text": "Ha ha ha!",
    "akali_3_scene_550_text": "Ahhh, whew.",
    "akali_3_scene_560_text": "You know, I’m scared of falling, too.",
    "akali_3_scene_570_text": "Really?",
    "akali_3_scene_580_text": "Of course. I think about the invasion all the time… Rakan died right in front of us… thousands of people lost their lives… and everyone just… moved on.",
    "akali_3_scene_590_text": "I wonder… is that what it’ll always be? Losing people we care about forever… until we lose each other? Ourselves? It doesn’t seem right. It doesn’t seem… fair.",
    "akali_3_scene_600_text": "And part of me wishes I could just go back to before. Before all that happened, before Zoe attacked, before we ever knew there was such a thing as Star Guardians.",
    "akali_3_scene_610_text": "When you and I would hang out at the arcade. Or listen to music in my bedroom.",
    "akali_3_scene_620_text": "Or make friendship bracelets?",
    "akali_3_scene_630_text": "Yeah… Man, they’re so janky. So embarrassing. If anyone tries to take mine, I’ll kill them.",
    "akali_3_scene_640_text": "Ha! Well… no matter what we do, that old life is gone now.",
    "akali_3_scene_650_text": "But the Kai’Sa from before? Your friend Kai’Sa? She’s not gone.",
    "akali_3_scene_660_text": "You’ve been talking to old Bill too much. Did he tell you about the five rocks made of problems or whatever?",
    "akali_3_scene_670_text": "The problem rocks! I still don’t know what he was talking about. Maybe I never will.",
    "akali_3_scene_680_text": "Yeah… You know, it’s kinda funny.",
    "akali_3_scene_690_text": "The danger we face every day. Our oath. The darkness.",
    "akali_3_scene_700_text": "You’re right, that is very funny.",
    "akali_3_scene_710_text": "Heh, shut up. It’s all so… overwhelming. And when I’m overwhelmed…",
    "akali_3_scene_720_text": "You make a joke?",
    "akali_3_scene_730_text": "Yeah! A really stupid one. Like, I call a pigeon a sky goblin.",
    "akali_3_scene_740_text": "AHAHAHA! A WHAT?!",
    "akali_3_scene_750_text": "A sky goblin! Because they gobble treasure and tell riddles!",
    "akali_3_scene_760_text": "Ak.. ahaha.. Akali… what do you think a goblin is?",
    "akali_3_scene_770_text": "I know what a goblin is! Hey, stop laughing! You’re gonna make me… ahaha!",
    "akali_3_scene_780_text": "Ah… oh… oh… my sides…",
    "akali_3_scene_790_text": "Ahhh, whew. Hey… whatever happens… let’s just try to be there for each other, okay? You did promise, after all.",
    "akali_3_scene_800_text": "You’re right, Kali. I did.",
    "akali_3_scene_810_text": "Friends ‘til the end? Even if that end super turbo sucks?",
    "akali_3_scene_820_text": "You and me, Kali. Until the sucky, turbo end.",
    "akali_3_scene_830_text": "…Pfft. Sky goblins.",
    "akali_3_scene_530a_10_text": "How can you be so sure?",
    "akali_3_scene_530a_20_text": "…I’m not.",
    "akali_3_scene_530a_30_text": "But I know you wouldn’t be doing this if all you cared about was a statue.",
    "akali_3_scene_530a_40_text": "Yeah, I’m more of a billboard person. Captures my image better.",
    "akali_3_scene_530b_10_text": "Yeah… you’re probably right.",
    "akali_3_scene_530b_20_text": "It’s easier if we don’t try to live up to Lux’s standards.",
    "akali_3_scene_530b_30_text": "Yeah, you were right. We can forge our own path.",
    "akali_3_scene_530b_40_text": "I want to be the first Star Guardian with an instant noodle brand. So much sodium your heart explodes right there at the table.",
    "akali_3_scene_530c_10_text": "Ooh, and at night, there’s a water show set to music.",
    "akali_3_scene_530c_20_text": "They can play our theme song! You know, the… burning one? Oh, no… I don’t know the theme song!",
    "akali_3_scene_530c_30_text": "You?! You, little miss leader, don’t know Burning Bright?",
    "akali_3_scene_530c_40_text": "This is an incredible day. Wow. I’m telling the entire squad. Nonnegotiable.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_10_text": "My, my. What a quaint little street.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_20_text": "They must have worked quickly to repair the damage after that brat botched her invasion last year. Hmph, what a waste.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_30_text": "And what did they replace all those buildings with, hm? Rows and rows of shops?",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_40_text": "Hmhmhm! As ever, these humans bend themselves toward such casual cruelties. Wealth extraction! It seems so antithetical to the entire Star Guardian ideal.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_50_text": "But what do I know? I'm a soon-to-be lowly homeroom teacher at a… public school. [Shiver!]",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_60_text": "Well, enough idling. I suppose it’s time to make a mess of things.",

    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_130_text": "Those are actual monsters! I don’t… I can’t focus… because of that stupid Fiddlesticks thing, ugh!",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_140_text": "P-please! Don’t hurt me! Waaaaagh!",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_150_text": "Where are the Star Guardians?! Where is Lux?! Help us!",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_160_text": "Ugh. Lux isn’t here anymore. Wish she was, but…",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_170_text": "Shoot. There are way too many of those things. People are going to get hurt.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_180_text": "You ready to put it all on the line, ‘Kali? We might not come back alive.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_190_text": "A…alive?! What do you mean? You think we might die out there?!",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_200_text": "Hey, maybe! But we’re Star Guardians!",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_210_text": "Or at least we’re supposed to be.",

    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_260_responseC": "Loving the checkerboard nightmare aesthetic. We should come here more often.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_280_text": "I’m not feeling that overwhelming sense of dread… It must not be here.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_290_text": "Whew… that’s a relief.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_300_text": "I sense that woman, though… She was here. Morgana.",

    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_320_text": "…I-I don’t… I don’t want…",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_330_text": "Hm! Yeah, I’ll be fine. The mission comes first.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_340_text": "Glad you’re with us, then. And don’t worry… I’ll keep you safe.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_350_text": "Pfft… Yeah… I know you will. You’re a Star Guardian. It’s what you do!",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_360_text": "Oh, my God. Fight now! Talk later!",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_370_text": "Whatever, boy genius. Let’s see what you’ve got out there.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_380_text": "I have Sona and Taliyah covering both ends of the street, so nothing is getting in or out.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_390_text": "Check your angles, and prioritize saving anyone in danger. We’re going in!",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_400_text": "It’s the big show, everyone! Get ready to make a statement!",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_410_text": "Excuse me, but I’m Ekko.",

    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_480_text": "I think so? I don’t see any more monsters.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_490_text": "And all that stuff that was warping the street is gone. I hesitate to say it, but…",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_490_responseA": "I think we might have won?",

    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_520_text": "That was crazy! I was over there, like, fwoom! And then Sona was, like, bwong! And you guys were, like, boooom! It was awesome!",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_530_text": "Semi-related, but there is a huge magical wall blocking the end of the street that I may have put there and cannot remove. We should go.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_540_text": "You’re never this amped at school, Tali.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_550_text": "Because I don’t have star powers or a cool outfit there, duh. Also, I smashed this monster with a huge rock, and it was like, “Bleeeurgh”.",

    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_720_text": "Heh. But, yeah… makes you wonder…",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_730_text": "Who else might be watching us?",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_270a_10_text": "Monsters, tons of them. They’re kinda puny by themselves, but there are at least a few dozen out there.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_270a_20_text": "We don’t know where they came from. And everything’s all… messed up… like when that creepy monster attacked us.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_270a_30_text": "I was wondering about that. The pattern looks familiar… What was that creature’s name? Fiddlesticks?",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_270a_40_text": "Ugh, I don’t wanna think about that thing. It showed up in my dreams… I’ll never forget that voice…",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_270b_10_text": "Copy that, Cap’n Kai. What’s the big plan?",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_270b_20_text": "Hm. Looks like a few dozen of them, and they’re coming out of that checkerboard goop.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_270b_30_text": "Sweep the street. We hit fast and hard, and close that breach.",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_270b_40_text": "Got it. What do we do if that Fiddlesticks thing shows up?",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_270b_50_text": "Ugh… Do you think it will?",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_270c_10_text": "Not the time, Kai’Sa!",
    "chapter_1_act_3_scene_270c_20_text": "Heh. You said “time.”",
