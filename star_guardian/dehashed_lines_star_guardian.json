    "kaisa_1_scene_150_text": "I went to the capital once when I was younger. Not much to see. Lots of buildings.",

    "kaisa_1_scene_540_text": "[Combative chirp!]",

    "taliyah_2_scene_360_text": "I was going through a lot back then… N-not that everyone else wasn’t! But I felt like I had to put my problems on hold.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_370_text": "Then I met you and Akali, I took the oath, and we all started training… Then school started up again… It all happened so fast…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_380_text": "Until I can figure out the way I want to dress, I’d rather wear this big hoodie. Then I can make my, you know, fashion debut… without anyone telling me how I should dress.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_390_text": "I-if that makes sense!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_400_text": "Huh… a fashion problem. You’re so confident as a Star Guardian… I never would have guessed.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_410_text": "Like I said, the Star Guardian outfit makes me feel like the person I want to be! If I can find some clothes like that… Well, maybe without the magical space powers…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_420_text": "I’m sure I could throw this ratty old hoodie away for good!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_430_text": "Uh… and maybe be more confident… at school. A-and other places. Here. The park. Etcetera.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_440_text": "Interesting…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_450_text": "Well, as your captain, I’d love to help! Only if you’ll let me, of course.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_460_text": "You’re more than my captain, Cap… uh, Kai’Sa. We’re friends! I-I think!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_470_text": "Though, uh… you’re not exactly the most… um…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_480_text": "Fashionable? Person?",
    "taliyah_2_scene_490_text": "Please, don’t be mad!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_490_responseA": "I do wear this uniform a lot…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_490_responseB": "There’s nothing wrong with student-body-president/fit-girlboss casual, Tali.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_490_responseC": "I have just become fully evil. I am now your archnemesis.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_510_text": "Hmm. You know who’s really on top of fashion trends? Akali.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_520_text": "Really?!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_530_text": "Oh… but are you two alright? You both seem… strained?",
    "taliyah_2_scene_540_text": "Ugh... I don’t know. I think we’re okay? It’s… complicated.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_550_text": "Regardless! She really likes you, so she’ll totally help update your look!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_560_text": "Really?! Oh, Captain, that’s amazing! Thank you!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_570_text": "Of course, Tali! You’re my—",
    "taliyah_2_scene_580_text": "Ow, ow, ow, my back. My sides. My legs. My head. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_590_text": "Argh! I’m really, really sorry! I never should have made you ride the pain train!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_600_text": "Café Cuties Bard… take me away…",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500a_10_text": "A-and there’s nothing wrong with that, Captain!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500a_20_text": "But, you know, it’s not for me.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500b_10_text": "I’ve been reading a lot of fashion magazines… and I don’t think that’s a thing.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500b_20_text": "It could be a thing.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500b_30_text": "Well...",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500c_10_text": "C-Captain! No!",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500c_20_text": "I’m going to build a giant, evil castle. With spikes. It’ll be awesome, and you can’t hang out in it.",
    "taliyah_2_scene_500c_30_text": "Oh… you’re joking. Whew.",
    "nilah_3_scene_10_text": "Th-that’s...!",
    "nilah_3_scene_20_text": "How are we supposed to beat this thing?! We’re not strong enough...!",
    "nilah_3_scene_30_text": "Show me whatcha got, coward! I’ve been ready to die since the day I was born!",
    "nilah_3_scene_40_text": "GYAOOOOOOON",
    "nilah_3_scene_50_text": "Wow, we didn’t stand a chance.",
    "nilah_3_scene_60_text": "Omega Gromp suffers no fools, Kai’Sa. That’s why he’s Omega, and you are not.",
    "nilah_3_scene_70_text": "Stupid VR machine! You made me lag! I got stream sniped! My headset disconnected!",
    "nilah_3_scene_80_text": "It doesn’t lag, we’re not streaming, and the headset is literally tied to your head.",
    "nilah_3_scene_90_text": "I just can’t believe I got melted by his stupid acid spit! It’s the slowest projectile in the game! It’s slower than the concept of slow! I’m so… freaking…",
    "nilah_3_scene_100_text": "OVER THIS!",
    "nilah_3_scene_110_text": "How is every member of this squad a toxic gamer? Literally all of you. I feel like we should talk about this.",
    "nilah_3_scene_120_text": "You’re very skilled, Rell! If you trusted your comrades a bit more, you’d be nearly unstoppable.",
    "nilah_3_scene_130_text": "Ugh, I just hate losing! And in front of Nilah?! I just met her and she’s already my role model!!",
    "nilah_3_scene_140_text": "I like her! She is learning to open her heart.",
    "nilah_3_scene_150_text": "I like her too.",
    "nilah_3_scene_160_text": "But what exactly are we supposed to be learning? How to die over and over in a video game?",
    "nilah_3_scene_170_text": "Ekko told me this is the most advanced combat simulator on the market. If you can’t figure out how to beat virtual giant monsters as a team…",
    "nilah_3_scene_180_text": "…then I could always attract a real monster into the downtown core. A really nasty one. And believe me, I really, really want to fight a giant monster.",
    "nilah_3_scene_180_responseA": "What do you mean by “really nasty?”",
    "nilah_3_scene_180_responseB": "As captain, I forbid you from endangering this city.",
    "nilah_3_scene_180_responseC": "You're Rell's role model? I've been trying to be her role model for WEEKS!",
    "nilah_3_scene_200_text": "Wow! That’s extremely horrifying!",
    "nilah_3_scene_210_text": "Why are you smiling if it’s horrifying?",
    "nilah_3_scene_220_text": "I don’t know! I’m really intimidated right now! Why did you sound so happy when you said those terrible, terrible things?",
    "nilah_3_scene_230_text": "I’m glad you asked! Hundreds of years ago, a joy monster erased my other emotions.",
    "nilah_3_scene_240_text": "Great! Awesome! Ekko, how are we doing so far?! Please feel free to jump in as quickly as possible...!",
    "nilah_3_scene_250_text": "I’ve reprogrammed Omega Gromp to be extremely aggressive and twice as strong. Been kinda breezy, if I’m being honest.",
    "nilah_3_scene_260_text": "I don’t think the average Arcade World employee cares too much about what I’m doing. Or… about anything else.",
    "nilah_3_scene_270_text": "Good. Nilah is getting that look in her eye when she senses a good fight, and she’s, uh… saying some very dark stuff? So we should probably start soon.",
    "nilah_3_scene_280_text": "One extra difficult VR boss encounter, coming up.",
    "nilah_3_scene_290_text": "Alright, team! This time we walk away with the win! Put your headsets on, and pair up.",
    "nilah_3_scene_300_text": "I can’t wait to get in there. Let’s see what you’ve all learned.",
    "nilah_3_scene_310_text": "Starting instance! Three, two, one...!",
    "nilah_3_scene_320_text": "Promise me you’ll teach them, Nilah. Until our fight is over… promise me you won’t let them fall.",
    "nilah_3_scene_330_text": "You know I can’t do that. It’s not within my power.",
    "nilah_3_scene_340_text": "Please, won’t you try? You’re so strong… and their light… it’s in terrible danger…",
    "nilah_3_scene_350_text": "If you could go back and save your friends… wouldn’t you...?",
    "nilah_3_scene_360_text": "...",
    "nilah_3_scene_370_text": "Alright, Luxanna Crownguard. I’ll teach them. I promise.",
    "nilah_3_scene_380_text": "W…what?! This isn’t the simulation!",
    "nilah_3_scene_390_text": "Relax, Kai’Sa. I spoke with Ekko beforehand. You’re supposed to be seeing this.",
    "nilah_3_scene_400_text": "So, the others…",
    "nilah_3_scene_410_text": "Are fighting a level-900 Omega Gromp. It’s probably not going well, but you never know.",
    "nilah_3_scene_420_text": "Then...",
    "nilah_3_scene_420_responseA": "Where are we, exactly?",
    "nilah_3_scene_420_responseB": "Is that a little baby planet? It’s so cute!",
    "nilah_3_scene_420_responseC": "I’m sorry about the “you being my dad” stuff. Please don’t kill me.",
    "nilah_3_scene_440_text": "[Mumbling.]",
    "nilah_3_scene_450_text": "…this, I promise.",
    "nilah_3_scene_460_text": "Hmm? Promise what?",
    "nilah_3_scene_470_text": "The truth is, I’m not a teacher. I’m not someone who can tell you how to be a better Star Guardian or how the organization works…",
    "nilah_3_scene_480_text": "…But I can teach you how to endure.",
    "nilah_3_scene_490_text": "“Star Guardians burn bright, but are destined to fall.” Isn’t that the saying?",
    "nilah_3_scene_500_text": "You will give everything, Kai’Sa. This is only the beginning. There will be more threats, and more tragedies, and losses you cannot even begin to imagine.",
    "nilah_3_scene_510_text": "This is all I have left. A chunk of rock in a distant, lifeless galaxy… a handful of books… and no one.",
    "nilah_3_scene_520_text": "Almost everyone I’ve ever loved is long gone. Nilah isn’t even my real name. The stories of me conquering legendary villains? They’ve replaced the person I once was.",
    "nilah_3_scene_530_text": "My days as a young girl… the smile on my mother’s face… I see them in half-formed dreams, yet feel only the weight of this accursed joy.",
    "nilah_3_scene_540_text": "Nilah…",
    "nilah_3_scene_550_text": "Don’t weep for me, Kai’Sa. Despite the loss, the danger, and the constant recitations, I face my future with a smile!",
    "nilah_3_scene_560_text": "There is much more to do and see! More lives to change, more foes to face! Friends to fight side by side with, against overwhelming odds!",
    "nilah_3_scene_570_text": "We cannot divert from the path we have taken, and we cannot regain what was lost… but we can enjoy what we have, when we have it, and hold it close.",
    "nilah_3_scene_580_text": "Hold your friends close, Kai’Sa. Hold them close, and know that darkness will always find you, no matter what form it may take… and try to wrest them away.",
    "nilah_3_scene_590_text": "Yet, despite all this… do not be afraid to find your joy, and endure.",
    "nilah_3_scene_600_text": "Do you understand?",
    "nilah_3_scene_610_text": "I think I do, Nilah. Thank you.",
    "nilah_3_scene_620_text": "Good! Then this little excursion wasn’t a waste.",
    "nilah_3_scene_630_text": "It wasn’t, Nilah. You’re extremely terrifying sometimes, but thanks… for looking out for us. I mean it.",
    "nilah_3_scene_640_text": "It is no trouble at all, Kai’Sa.",
    "nilah_3_scene_650_text": "You and your friends… Stick together, and I think you’ll be alright.",
    "nilah_3_scene_660_text": "You’re one of us too, y’know! We’re all stuck with each other now, no matter what you say.",
    "nilah_3_scene_670_text": "Ha! I know. I was just waiting for you to admit it.",
    "nilah_3_scene_680_text": "Consider your promise kept, Luxanna Crownguard.",
    "nilah_3_scene_690_text": "Buuuut… maybe I’ll stick around a while longer. You know… just to see what happens next.",
    "nilah_3_scene_190a_10_text": "Imagine a creature so twisted by darkness that looking at it is like throwing your unprotected mind into the core of the sun.",
    "nilah_3_scene_190a_20_text": "Its shadow swallows the entire sky. Each footstep is a cataclysm on par with a globe-spanning extinction event, wiping out millions of innocents without so much as a thought.",
    "nilah_3_scene_190a_30_text": "I fight monsters like these all the time. And I can find another one for us to take on, if you like.",
    "nilah_3_scene_190b_10_text": "Heh. You wish to force me into submission?",
    "nilah_3_scene_190b_20_text": "N-no, I…",
    "nilah_3_scene_190b_30_text": "If I recall correctly, you didn’t fare so well last time… and I was holding back. Care to try again at my full strength? I’d love the practice.",
    "nilah_3_scene_190c_10_text": "Perhaps you tried too hard, Kai'Sa. Being a role model comes with experience.",
    "nilah_3_scene_190c_20_text": "And I've experienced... centuries. I've seen hundreds, no, thousands of Star Guardians just like you rise against the dark, only to be snuffed out like candles in a hurricane.",
    "nilah_3_scene_190c_30_text": "I’ve survived, and whether you like it or not, I’ve been charged with making sure you don’t vanish into the screaming abyss like all those who came before.",
    "nilah_3_scene_430a_10_text": "This is my little pocket of the universe. That right there? That’s my home.",
    "nilah_3_scene_430a_20_text": "But… it’s so small…",
    "nilah_3_scene_430a_30_text": "It’s all that I need. A place to sit, a few good books, a cup of tea, and silence.",
    "nilah_3_scene_430b_10_text": "I’m glad you think so. It’s a place I come to in order to rest and refocus.",
    "nilah_3_scene_430b_20_text": "I didn’t expect it to look like this…",
    "nilah_3_scene_430b_30_text": "A true warrior doesn’t need much. Just a few essentials, and a little quiet.",
    "nilah_3_scene_430c_10_text": "Ha! It was a little strange, but then again… we’re all a bit off, aren’t we?",
    "nilah_3_scene_430c_20_text": "You’re right. We are.",
    "nilah_3_scene_430c_30_text": "That’s the spirit. Embrace your differences, and you won’t need anything else in the world.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_10_text": "Uh… I dunno about this one…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_20_text": "I think it looks nice.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_30_text": "You’re not looking with a critical eye. You want to accentuate the hips and waistline while drawing the eye across the midsection.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_40_text": "I don’t know what that means.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_50_text": "Kai, I love you. You know I do. Now get out of this dressing room right now before I stab you.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_60_text": "Ugh! Fine!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_70_text": "[Baaaah.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_80_text": "You, too, Aru?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_90_text": "[Behhh.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_100_text": "Well, that’s your fault. Just because you can pull off a bucket hat, doesn’t mean everyone can!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_110_text": "[Bleeeeeehhh.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_120_text": "And what’s so bad about jeggings?! They’re for work and for play!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_130_text": "[Baaaabaaah.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_140_text": "Whatever. Stupid alpaca. Telling me what to do. You don’t even have hands.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_150_text": "Welp. No dice.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_160_text": "Sorry, everyone! I don’t mean to be a bother!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_170_text": "[Beeeehhh.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_180_text": "Thank you, Aru! That’s a very good point!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_190_text": "We may not know what works, but we did find out what doesn’t work. That means we’re getting close.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_200_text": "Really?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_210_text": "Yeah, wait, really?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_220_text": "Kai, I wouldn’t expect you to know this because your personal fashion is whatever the rules say is mandatory…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_230_text": "Hmph. At least it’s functional.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_240_text": "But Taliyah requires a deft, and fashionable, hand. Process of elimination is still a process. I’m pretty sure you told me that in a very boring speech about something.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_240_responseA": "The mathematics of magical artillery is not boring!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_240_responseB": "Let’s see how you like it when the enemy switches to mixed-infantry tactics.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_240_responseC": "Better hope we never fight alternate versions of ourselves sent by an evil corporation.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_250_text": "BOO! NOT FUN!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_260_text": "And I only say that because I love you.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_270_text": "Ugh, fine. I’ll give you a pass.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_280_text": "Thatta girl. Now… Taliyah.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_290_text": "!!!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_300_text": "Hmm… I have some ideas. Stick here with Kai while I grab some stuff from different stores.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_310_text": "You’re not gonna shoplift, are you?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_320_text": "Oh, what’s that? I need Aru’s help for an undisclosed reason? Come on, little buddy. Let’s make some magic happen.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_330_text": "[Beehhhh.]",
    "taliyah_3_scene_340_text": "Akali! Don’t steal!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_350_text": "Ugh… My dad’s gonna kill me…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_360_text": "Heh heh. You two are funny.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_370_text": "…We are. We’re pretty funny.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_380_text": "I hope this works… I would love to find something I can wear that isn’t, you know, gonna blow our cover and reveal our secret identities to the world.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_390_text": "N-no pressure though!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_400_text": "Don’t worry about that right now. Akali has… unconventional methods… but I bet she’ll know what to do.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_410_text": "I just wanna figure out my own look. It feels so frustrating… This should have been really easy!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_420_text": "Every other girl in school did it! I see you all walking around on the weekends… You all look amazing, while I’m balled up in this big, dumb hoodie.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_430_text": "Dumb? Why’s the hoodie dumb? I thought it was part of the mystique of figuring out your, you know… big fashion debut.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_440_text": "I mean… sure… That’s true…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_450_text": "It’s also one of the only things we saved from our old house.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_460_text": "Oh, Tali… I’m sorry…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_470_text": "N-no, no! It’s not that bad! Everybody came together in our neighborhood and built it all back a hundred times better!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_480_text": "It just feels like… this hoodie is holding me back in that time...",
    "taliyah_3_scene_490_text": "Like… I can’t move on. I know, it sounds really dumb. But that’s the way I feel.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_500_text": "Have you ever felt like you can’t move on, Captain?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_500_responseA": "I lost someone close, once.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_500_responseB": "The night of the invasion. I keep seeing it in my dreams.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_500_responseC": "How could they do that to Viego?! Of all the Café Cuties, why him?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_520_text": "S-seems like we both have some ghosts.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_530_text": "Yeah, maybe.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_540_text": "But we’ll figure it out together.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_550_text": "Yeah!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_560_text": "RUN!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_570_text": "Hello! We need to go right now! I may have gone overboard!",
    "speaker_security": "SECURITY",
    "taliyah_3_scene_580_text": "Hey! Someone stop that girl and her weird, tall dog!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_590_text": "We can talk about this later! Book it!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_600_text": "...",
    "taliyah_3_scene_610_text": "Well? What do you bad dudes think?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_620_text": "I think I look hot. But approachable. Also, I could kick a monster off the top of a skyscraper. Star kick! Chu chu!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_630_text": "There she is. That’s the Taliyah I know.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_640_text": "Glad you found your look, Tali. Wanna wear it out? Maybe kick a villain off a skyscraper?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_650_text": "Soon, all will be revealed! But not yet. I wanna save it for the exact right moment.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_660_text": "Alright, hoodie, looks like you and I are gonna do one last big score before retirement. Yee-haw!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_670_text": "Oh, wow. The tag says these leggings are… oh, wow.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_680_text": "Kali, how much did these clothes cost?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_690_text": "They were free. Shut up.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_700_text": "Those are crazy-expensive designer brands. What did you do?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_710_text": "I did what had to be done, O Great and Mighty Captain.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_720_text": "Also, I may be banned from the bottom floor of the mall until their security team retires. No big deal.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_730_text": "We’ll talk about this later.",
    "taliyah_3_scene_740_text": "Aaaaand I’m back. What were you two talking about? Doing crimes?",
    "taliyah_3_scene_750_text": "Tali! You’re in your academy outfit?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_760_text": "I thought you hated that thing?!",
    "taliyah_3_scene_770_text": "Yeah, I did. But after seeing myself in my awesome new outfit…",
    "taliyah_3_scene_780_text": "...I realized maybe it’s not the clothes holding me back. It’s just me. But now… I feel really good.",

    "chapter_3_act_1_scene_820_text": "…Ugh. Aren’t you gonna follow her?",
    "chapter_3_act_1_scene_830_text": "…No. I’m bound to protect you and your friends. Facing Morgana is… tempting… but it is not what I promised.",

    "chapter_3_act_1_scene_170c_10_text": "That sounds perfectly reasonable… but she hasn’t been at Noodle Bill’s in a few days. I asked.",

    "chapter_3_act_1_scene_170c_30_text": "I-I don’t know what to do. She’s not answering her texts… and she’s really gloomy in class…",

    "rell_2_scene_340_text": "I had to do exactly what they told me so they could get well connected, you know? Horseback riding, student government, being quiet at boring benefit dinners…",
    "rell_2_scene_350_text": "And if I did anything they didn’t like… well…",
    "rell_2_scene_360_text": "…they’d chase off my friends. Give away my stuff. Send me away for entire summers. I could never get close to anyone…",
    "rell_2_scene_370_text": "That’s so awful. I assume your parents don’t keep in touch.",
    "rell_2_scene_380_text": "Nah.",
    "rell_2_scene_390_text": "After a while, I couldn’t take the pressure. I just wanted to be able to be myself…my true self.",
    "rell_2_scene_400_text": "Turns out being my true self wasn’t good enough for them. I was a “huge embarrassment” that “wasted her unlimited potential.”",
    "rell_2_scene_410_text": "I’m actually grateful they shipped me off to VC. I needed a fresh start, away from Kiiso.",
    "rell_2_scene_420_text": "But here… I figure it’s best not to make new friends. That way, it’s harder to disappoint anyone.",
    "rell_2_scene_430_text": "Quinn knows where I come from. She understands… that I’m always just trying to do what’s right. And that if I push people away, it’s only to protect them.",
    "rell_2_scene_440_text": "You know what I mean?",
    "rell_2_scene_440_responseA": "I understand you, Rell.",
    "rell_2_scene_440_responseB": "You’re part of a squad now, and we’ll all look out for you.",
    "rell_2_scene_440_responseC": "What’s this comic..? “That Time I Was Transported to the Spirit World”?",
    "rell_2_scene_460_text": "Rell… you don’t need to be so hard on yourself. You’re cool. We WANT to be your friend.",
    "rell_2_scene_470_text": "How about we make a deal?",
    "rell_2_scene_480_text": "A deal? What kind of deal?",
    "rell_2_scene_490_text": "You be the most authentic Rell you can be. Defend first years, talk to statues, defend babies from evil space deers… No matter what, I’ll stand by your side.",
    "rell_2_scene_500_text": "I like where this is going.",
    "rell_2_scene_510_text": "But in exchange… you open up to us. Let us be a part of your life.",
    "rell_2_scene_520_text": "Okay… maybe I like this a little less…",
    "rell_2_scene_530_text": "… Even the part of your life that includes secretly reading manga.",
    "rell_2_scene_540_text": "MANGA?! I have no clue what you’re talking about!",
    "rell_2_scene_550_text": "Rell! You literally just showed me your collection.",
    "rell_2_scene_560_text": "Sorry, sorry. Force of habit.",
    "rell_2_scene_570_text": "Hmm…I dunno if I can keep my part of the deal. There’s a reason I don’t have too many friends, K.",
    "rell_2_scene_580_text": "My family has resources to reach me anywhere. Who’s to say I won’t lose all of you…that I’ll lose Quinn…",
    "rell_2_scene_590_text": "Let them try to scare us off! We aren’t going anywhere.",
    "rell_2_scene_600_text": "You mean it? Even with all my baggage? You’re really sure you want me around?",
    "rell_2_scene_610_text": "No one is perfect. And I’m sure.",
    "rell_2_scene_620_text": "Heh. Okay. Let me think about it, alright?",
    "rell_2_scene_630_text": "In the meantime, wanna read Derelict Emperor? His only weakness is scorpions, but so far, nobody knows that… except for the Crystal Knight, Sir Skarner.",
    "rell_2_scene_640_text": "I ship them for completely normal reasons. You can’t tell anybody, and that doesn’t count as part of our deal.",
    "rell_2_scene_650_text": "S-sorry, but… what’s a ship?",
    "rell_2_scene_660_text": "K, get ready to reach a state of pure enlightenment.",
    "rell_2_scene_450a_10_text": "Ah, uh… y-yeah. Thanks.",
    "rell_2_scene_450a_20_text": "Normally, I’d get really defensive right now. Just an FYI. I’m not great with new… uh… friends.",
    "rell_2_scene_450a_30_text": "I don’t know you too well yet… so just… give me time, alright?",
    "rell_2_scene_450b_10_text": "A team… Aw, man.",
    "rell_2_scene_450b_20_text": "I just hope Tali and E feel the same way…",
    "rell_2_scene_450b_30_text": "figured if I kept you at a distance, it would make things easier. Rookie mistake.",
    "rell_2_scene_450c_10_text": "Are you… unfamiliar with this masterwork of modern literature?",
    "rell_2_scene_450c_20_text": "I usually only read assigned textbooks…",
    "rell_2_scene_450c_30_text": "So, the story takes place in this fantasy world where a mild-mannered festivalgoer falls into the realm of the spirits…",
    "rell_2_scene_450c_40_text": "And then… Er, we can talk about this later. In one volume, this snake lady crushes the protagonist, and it is explicit, if you know what I mean.",
    "quinn_3_scene_10_text": "And that… that would be for me to decide.",
    "quinn_3_scene_20_text": "…I, uh…",
    "quinn_3_scene_30_text": "Thank you, Akali.",
    "quinn_3_scene_40_text": "Woo! Great job, Kali!",
    "quinn_3_scene_50_text": "You can stop applauding now. I totally bombed up there.",
    "quinn_3_scene_60_text": "Just showing my support for the mad bomber.",
    "quinn_3_scene_70_text": "Heh. That’s good. I’m keeping that one.",
    "quinn_3_scene_80_text": "Quinn, you’re up next.",
    "quinn_3_scene_90_text": "Oh, yeah. How’d prep go with your new study buddy?",
    "quinn_3_scene_100_text": "Not great, actually. We weren’t very productive.",
    "quinn_3_scene_110_text": "Oh, noooo. Did her bird eat her homework?",
    "quinn_3_scene_120_text": "…You know, she’s actually very nice.",
    "quinn_3_scene_130_text": "And she’s one of us now, so be cool.",
    "quinn_3_scene_140_text": "I’m being serious. Did her bird—?",
    "quinn_3_scene_150_text": "Akali! Your presentation is over. Please, be quiet.",
    "quinn_3_scene_160_text": "…Lame.",
    "quinn_3_scene_170_text": "Ahem. Hi. I’m Quinn.",
    "quinn_3_scene_180_text": "[C’mon, Quinn. You got this.]",
    "quinn_3_scene_190_text": "I know I’m still pretty new here, and many of you don’t know me…",
    "quinn_3_scene_200_text": "But I hope that you will soon.",
    "quinn_3_scene_210_text": "I spent my whole life in one small town surrounded by huge, sprawling mountains…",
    "quinn_3_scene_220_text": "Its name is Kiiso.",
    "quinn_3_scene_230_text": "It’s the kind of place where everyone knows each other… No matter where you go, there’s always a familiar face.",
    "quinn_3_scene_240_text": "To me, it’s a place where promises are never broken and friendships last a lifetime.",
    "quinn_3_scene_250_text": "It was… a fairytale. But fairytales always end.",
    "quinn_3_scene_260_text": "My academics were strong enough that I was moved to an accelerated learning program. So… I ended up coming to VC, and leaving Kiiso behind.",
    "quinn_3_scene_270_text": "My family, most of my friends, and all the memories I’d made there with them… I thought I’d left them all behind. It… it really scared me.",
    "quinn_3_scene_280_text": "I… I thought that my life was over. It was tough to adjust, and in a lot of ways, it still is.",
    "quinn_3_scene_290_text": "But I found a new life here, in Valoran City. New friends, new adventures…",
    "quinn_3_scene_300_text": "And it’s just the beginning…",
    "quinn_3_scene_310_text": "I really liked your story.",
    "quinn_3_scene_320_text": "Thanks. I was pretty nervous.",
    "quinn_3_scene_330_text": "Really?! You didn’t seem nervous at all!",
    "quinn_3_scene_340_text": "Oh, yeah. I got some good public-speaking advice from a friend.",
    "quinn_3_scene_350_text": "…From me?",
    "quinn_3_scene_360_text": "No, from Rell. She said to picture the entire class as a “pack of evil deer” and myself as a brave warrior defending the Valoran City Park…",
    "quinn_3_scene_370_text": "That sounds like Rell.",
    "quinn_3_scene_380_text": "It does, haha! That type of thing would only work for her.",
    "quinn_3_scene_390_text": "I just pictured everyone as the scary, non-deer monsters we’ve been facing.",
    "quinn_3_scene_400_text": "And I pretended I had the team at my side. Rell, of course, featured heavily. When she’s riding Sebastien, she’s, like, eight feet tall.",
    "quinn_3_scene_410_text": "I understand. Sometimes, being a Star Guardian can be easier than being…",
    "quinn_3_scene_420_text": "…Yourself.",
    "quinn_3_scene_430_text": "...Yeah.",
    "quinn_3_scene_440_text": "This oath we took… it bonds us for life. Shine bright, only to burn out.",
    "quinn_3_scene_450_text": "It’s scary… but it’s good, you know?",
    "quinn_3_scene_460_text": "Friendship can be so fleeting. One day you wake up… and it’s gone.",
    "quinn_3_scene_470_text": "You’ll always remember the friends you left behind in Kiiso.",
    "quinn_3_scene_480_text": "Every day. Not because of all the good times we had…",
    "quinn_3_scene_490_text": "But because of all the good times we didn’t get to have. You know?",
    "quinn_3_scene_500_text": "…I miss Akali.",
    "quinn_3_scene_510_text": "I mean—I still see her every day. But it’s different.",
    "quinn_3_scene_520_text": "What do you miss the most?",
    "quinn_3_scene_520_responseA": "We used to sing together at karaoke.",
    "quinn_3_scene_520_responseB": "Reading the new chapters of this webtoon she loves.",
    "quinn_3_scene_520_responseC": "I just liked laughing with her. It was so easy before.",
    "quinn_3_scene_530_text": "You don’t think that can happen again?",
    "quinn_3_scene_540_text": "I don’t know. I just know that growing up is a drag.",
    "quinn_3_scene_550_text": "Put that quote in the next Star Guardian Daily Planner.",
    "quinn_3_scene_560_text": "Ooh. Being quoted in there would be awesome.",
    "quinn_3_scene_570_text": "Too bad they don’t take open submissions.",
    "quinn_3_scene_580_text": "I have a whole list of quotes, though they probably need some work.",
    "quinn_3_scene_590_text": "Aww… I never thought I’d turn down an opportunity to proofread, but I think we have bigger problems to worry about.",
    "quinn_3_scene_600_text": "I suppose my dreams of becoming a published author can wait until AFTER we face Morgana.",
    "quinn_3_scene_610_text": "… There’s no going back to the way things were, is there?",
    "quinn_3_scene_620_text": "No, not for us.",
    "quinn_3_scene_630_text": "We’re the only people that will ever understand what it’s like…",
    "quinn_3_scene_640_text": "…to hold the fate of the universe in our hands.",
    "quinn_3_scene_650_text": "Yeah. I try to talk to Valor about this stuff, but he’s not a great conversationalist.",
    "quinn_3_scene_650_responseA": "You can always talk to me.",
    "quinn_3_scene_650_responseB": "Sometimes, it’s best to deal with it alone.",
    "quinn_3_scene_650_responseC": "You might say he’s a little… bird-brained? Eh? Ehhhh?",
    "quinn_3_scene_670_text": "…You seem like you always have things under control.",
    "quinn_3_scene_680_text": "Guess you’re not the only one who wears a mask.",
    "quinn_3_scene_690_text": "Ha! Valor liked that one.",
    "quinn_3_scene_700_text": "I mean… I did too. Not as much. You have to work on your delivery.",
    "quinn_3_scene_710_text": "Could I… feed Valor? I’ve always been curious… and he seems so hard to approach…",
    "quinn_3_scene_720_text": "Sure! I brought some snacks.",
    "quinn_3_scene_730_text": "I like to take him out here and let him fly around.",
    "quinn_3_scene_740_text": "It’s as close to Kiiso as we can get.",
    "quinn_3_scene_750_text": "I like it here, too. It calms me down when I’m feeling overwhelmed.",
    "quinn_3_scene_760_text": "You can see all of Valoran City… the winding streets, the giant skyscrapers…",
    "quinn_3_scene_770_text": "It’s beautiful in its own way.",
    "quinn_3_scene_780_text": "Yeah… I guess it is.",
    "quinn_3_scene_660a_10_text": "Thanks. You’re easy to talk to.",
    "quinn_3_scene_660a_20_text": "I try really hard to be.",
    "quinn_3_scene_660a_30_text": "You don’t need to try. You’re a pro.",
    "quinn_3_scene_660b_10_text": "Yeah, I guess I need time to process my thoughts.",
    "quinn_3_scene_660b_20_text": "Otherwise, my words come out all “bleh.”",
    "quinn_3_scene_660b_30_text": "Bleh.",
    "quinn_3_scene_660b_40_text": "I was just thinking that!",
    "quinn_3_scene_660c_10_text": "Hey! He’s really sensitive about those kinds of jokes.",
    "quinn_3_scene_660c_20_text": "Oops! Sorry.",
    "quinn_3_scene_660c_30_text": "Sometimes, I don’t think before I speak. It’s… gotten me into trouble before.",
    "quinn_3_scene_660c_40_text": "Really? Me, too! I’ll just talk, and it comes out all “bleh.” But you…",
    "kaisa_3_scene_10_text": "Good morning, everybody!",
    "kaisa_3_scene_20_text": "[Surprised cheep.]",
    "kaisa_3_scene_30_text": "I know! I can’t believe I slept in so late!",

    "kaisa_3_scene_80_text": "It’s important to find a work/life/school/Star Guardian balance.",
    "kaisa_3_scene_90_text": "I almost forgot what it was like to sleep in after staying up late watching documentaries… eating an acceptable number of healthy snacks… staying hydrated…",
    "kaisa_3_scene_100_text": "You know, typical high schooler stuff!",
    "kaisa_3_scene_110_text": "[Reluctantly questioning cheep.]",

    "nilah_1_scene_180_text": "Haha! I knew that! I totally understood that!",
    "nilah_1_scene_190_text": "[Idiot! Your first talk with a real guardian, and you’re blowing it!]",
    "nilah_1_scene_200_text": "So… what are you doing? I thought we could get to know each other… you know, if that’s alright with you…",
    "nilah_1_scene_210_text": "...",
    "nilah_1_scene_220_text": "Maybe you could… show me the ropes? Teach me some Star Guardian wisdom or something?",
    "nilah_1_scene_230_text": "“Wisdom?” I’m a warrior, Kai’Sa. I can teach you how to fight, and how to survive.",
    "nilah_1_scene_240_text": "But if you insist… I’ll share what I know. I warn you, I may not have your answers. Few Guardians live as long as I have. Of those who have, none recorded their learnings.",
    "nilah_1_scene_250_text": "Ulp! W-wait, I didn’t prepare…",
    "nilah_1_scene_260_text": "Ask me any question you wish. This first one is a courtesy. The rest you’ll have to earn. Preferably through combat.",
    "nilah_1_scene_270_text": "Oh, okay! Uh, let’s see…",
    "nilah_1_scene_270_responseA": "What can you tell me about the oath?",
    "nilah_1_scene_270_responseB": "Where do all those monsters come from?",
    "nilah_1_scene_270_responseC": "I had a dream where you were my dad.",
    "nilah_1_scene_290_text": "There. From now on, you will earn your answers through rigor or guile.",
    "nilah_1_scene_300_text": "[Mumbling.]",
    "nilah_1_scene_310_text": "What was that thing you did just now?",
    "nilah_1_scene_320_text": "You mean this? It’s a special gesture paired with a recitation. It prevents my power from consuming me, and I must perform it often.",
    "nilah_1_scene_330_text": "The recitation isn’t anything special. Usually, I quote literature or an old Star Guardian text. The passage must, however, bring me joy.",
    "nilah_1_scene_340_text": "Are you saying you’re constantly on the verge of falling?",
    "nilah_1_scene_350_text": "…Not as you understand it, no. Guardians who live long enough may chance upon powers beyond even the First Star’s capabilities.",
    "nilah_1_scene_360_text": "As the centuries passed, I encountered one myself. And in our own ways, we both emerged victorious.",
    "nilah_1_scene_370_text": "Centuries?!",
    "nilah_1_scene_380_text": "Is that strange? Many Outer Guardians are hundreds or even thousands of years old.",
    "nilah_1_scene_390_text": "Thousands of years? What about your families, your friends?",
    "nilah_1_scene_400_text": "All gone, I’m afraid.",
    "nilah_1_scene_410_text": "The oath magically halts aging. All Star Guardians are destined to die in battle or in darkness. There is no third option.",
    "nilah_1_scene_420_text": "You will see all that you care for live, grow old, and fade away. Cities will rise and fall, great threats will menace the universe and be destroyed…",
    "nilah_1_scene_430_text": "…and you will see your closest friends, those who knew you best… fall in turn. Until, if you are unlucky enough, you are the last one left.",
    "nilah_1_scene_440_text": "[Mumbling.]",
    "nilah_1_scene_450_text": "A prayer, offered for the departed.",
    "nilah_1_scene_460_text": "So, everyone you knew is gone? There’s no one left who remembers you?",
    "nilah_1_scene_470_text": "Dahlia remembers.",
    "speaker_dahlia": "DAHLIA",
    "nilah_1_scene_480_text": "[Yee hee hee!]",
    "nilah_1_scene_490_text": "Well spoken, old friend. You are wise beyond your many, many years.",
    "nilah_1_scene_490_responseA": "I know it’s rude, but how old are you, exactly?",
    "nilah_1_scene_490_responseB": "Where’s the rest of your squad? Are they still around?",
    "nilah_1_scene_490_responseC": "Is that a hyena ball? A ball that’s also a hyena?",
    "nilah_1_scene_510_text": "Ah, I wasn’t supposed to answer another question! Well played, Kai’Sa.",
    "nilah_1_scene_520_text": "Th-thanks. You make me really nervous.",
    "nilah_1_scene_530_text": "Ha! Luxanna Crownguard mentioned I might intimidate you. I was hoping she’d be right!",
    "nilah_1_scene_540_text": "Luxanna… Do you mean Lux? You know Lux?!",
    "nilah_1_scene_550_text": "Who do you think asked me to train you?",
    "nilah_1_scene_560_text": "I… I… What’s she like?! Did she say anything else?! What did—?",
    "nilah_1_scene_570_text": "Another time, Kai’Sa. It is my job to prepare you for the many threats you will face.",
    "nilah_1_scene_580_text": "Remember: Do well and win knowledge. Hahaha!",
    "nilah_1_scene_590_text": "Nilah…",
    "nilah_1_scene_600_text": "Alright, time to nail some training.",
    "nilah_1_scene_280a_10_text": "A very good question! The oath is a bond between the First Star, the First Light, and a prospective guardian. Think of the First Star as… a broker in a transaction.",
    "nilah_1_scene_280a_20_text": "Like it’s a middleman?!",
    "nilah_1_scene_280a_30_text": "Both Light and Star are very similar—perhaps even one and the same, if the truly ancient guardians are to be believed.",
    "nilah_1_scene_280a_40_text": "The First Star is born of the First Light and is its physical manifestation in this universe. The oath we take connects us to that avatar, and through it, we gain power.",
    "nilah_1_scene_280b_10_text": "Monsters?! The manifestation of dark forces in the universe, the great hounds of anti-light!",
    "nilah_1_scene_280b_20_text": "Whoa! Are you okay?!",
    "nilah_1_scene_280b_30_text": "These beasts are tied to chaos and entropy, spawned from their well of darkness. It is a great cycle that gives us the gift of these colossal foes, so we might test our strength against them!",
    "nilah_1_scene_280b_40_text": "…Ahem. My apologies. The idea of facing another titanic beast… Whew, it’s very exciting.",
    "nilah_1_scene_280c_10_text": "That is extremely disturbing.",
    "nilah_1_scene_280c_20_text": "I’m really sorry.",
    "nilah_1_scene_280c_30_text": "It’s also not a question, but I’m counting it as one. You have lost your question privileges.",
    "nilah_1_scene_280c_40_text": "If this is what I have to work with, I swear…",
    "nilah_1_scene_500a_10_text": "My team was the seventh to be inducted. In our day, we were quite the heroes.",
    "nilah_1_scene_500a_20_text": "WHAT?! That would make you...!",
    "nilah_1_scene_500a_30_text": "Far too old for high school! Hahaha!",
    "nilah_1_scene_500b_10_text": "Sadly, most are gone. The Twilight Star claimed one. Two were lost in a legendary battle for the fate of the universe… though that’s a tale for another day.",
    "nilah_1_scene_500b_20_text": "One remains. Though I haven’t seen him in almost a thousand years… I assume he’s still out there somewhere, slaying monsters to prove his strength.",
    "nilah_1_scene_500b_30_text": "He was always a proud one.",
    "nilah_1_scene_500c_10_text": "She’s more hyena than ball, but it’s an apt description.",
    "nilah_1_scene_500c_20_text": "[Yip yee hee!]",
    "nilah_1_scene_500c_30_text": "Of course you’re a great warrior. We’re all very impressed.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_10_text": "Gyoooohhhhhnnnn…!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_20_text": "Gyoooohhhhhhhnnnn!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_30_text": "Another one!? Wh-what’s going on?!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_40_text": "That thing is gigantic! It’s way bigger than the monsters from before!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_50_text": "Gyooooohhnnnnnn!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_60_text": "R-run!! Run for your lives!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_70_text": "See? Look at that. The darkness isn’t so bad.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_80_text": "I think it’s rather beautiful… and the operatic singing voice was a nice touch. Don’t you agree, Herald?",
    "speaker_dark_herald": "DARK HERALD",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_90_text": "Gyooooohhnnnnnn!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_100_text": "Whatever. I don’t care if you kill anyone, I just don’t want to see them die.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_110_text": "No? Well, you’ll develop a taste for it eventually. This promises to be quite the show.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_120_text": "Do your best, Herald. I await as much death and destruction as you’re able to handle.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_130_text": "...",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_140_text": "Be safe, Kai… Just hold on a little longer…",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_150_text": "Gyoooooohhhnnnnn!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_160_text": "Okay, now we’re fighting evil space kaiju? What is going on, Kai?!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_170_text": "[“If we don’t stop it soon, that creature will reach downtown! All those people...!”]",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_180_text": "I’m trying to think of something… It’s so big… If only we had someone who loves fighting giant monsters…",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_190_text": "Aha! A Dark Herald! I haven’t seen one of these in a hundred years!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_200_text": "Worthy enemy, face me in storied battle! Find your joy in the heart of combat, and our legend will dance through time immemorial!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_210_text": "Okay, I like her a lot.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_220_text": "[“She’s fun and strong! Feels like she’d fit right in!”]",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_230_text": "Kai’Sa. Do you have a plan? As my acting captain, I defer to you.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_240_text": "Me?! Aren’t you an Outer Guardian?",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_250_text": "I am. But I’m supposed to be teaching you, not doing your job.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_260_text": "If I slay this beast for you, what will you learn? Morgana is far more powerful and represents a much greater threat.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_270_text": "The deaths of any inexperienced guardians will be firmly on my hands. It would take me twenty… thirty… maybe fifty years to get over the guilt.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_280_text": "I’m so glad you care.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_290_text": "You are welcome!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_300_text": "Hi? Everyone? Giant monster?!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_310_text": "GYOOOOHHHHHHNNNN!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_320_text": "Hmm. It’s almost here.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_320_responseA": "Ekko, take Sona and Tali. Sweep the streets of any smaller creatures.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_320_responseB": "Nilah, you’re with me. Rell and Quinn are backing us up.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_320_responseC": "…Has anyone seen Akali?!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_340_text": "H-hey! Ekko, Sona, wait up! I wanna punch some stuff, too!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_350_text": "You’ve been spending way too much time with Taliyah.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_360_text": "So now team bonding is a bad thing?",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_370_text": "I thought I was making good progress, thank you very much!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_380_text": "Thanks for coming, you two. The more guardians we have on our side, the more people we can save.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_390_text": "And we’d better save ‘em fast. Look at the size of that thing! Sebastien and I are ready to charge that monster like Don Quixote.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_400_text": "Ah, a fellow enjoyer of the classics!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_410_text": "Mecha Don Quixote uses a lance of meteor metal stolen from the Zalbaxian Empire...!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_420_text": "Oh my God.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_430_text": "Focus up, team. This is the biggest monster we’ve ever faced, and the safety of the city is in our hands.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_440_text": "Nilah, can you cut us a path through the Herald’s attacks? If we can reach that lady on its head, we can win this, but those claws are massive, and there are a lot of them.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_450_text": "Without question. They will sing of my skill for all of time.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_460_text": "Glad to hear it.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_470_text": "Rell… when we’re through, charge into the Herald’s center of mass. Hit it as hard as you can, as many times as you can.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_480_text": "Now we’re talkin’! GYOOOHHHHN!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_490_text": "Oh, that’s… erm… okay. Happy about the enthusiasm.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_500_text": "Uh… this isn’t your favorite part of the job?",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_510_text": "Charging in headfirst isn’t everyone’s style, y’know…",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_520_text": "It’s only the BEST one!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_530_text": "Quinn, you and Valor stick to me. Once Rell stuns the Herald, you and I are going in for the kill.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_540_text": "Our eyes are yours, Captain.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_550_text": "Get ready, team. It’s just us this time… so let's prove those other victories weren’t flukes!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_560_text": "There were other victories?",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_570_text": "I don’t think we were here for those.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_580_text": "Just fight!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_590_text": "GYOOOOOOHHNNNNNNN!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_600_text": "Seize the bliss in your heart, and face me!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_610_text": "Now it’s my turn, loser. Bad luck!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_620_text": "The head is exposed! Valor, to me!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_630_text": "I don’t know where you came from, but this is our city! The Star Guardians will never back down!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_640_text": "Gyoooooooohnnnnn…!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_650_text": "[CRASH!]",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_660_text": "Hmph. Your stupid little friends are stronger than I anticipated.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_670_text": "It doesn’t matter. The darkness unleashed by the Herald is more than enough…",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_680_text": "Yes… Such power… This is what it must have felt like when Zoe became the Twilight Star!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_690_text": "Mhmhmhahaha! Justice will die! Entropy will reign forever! And you, girl… You… will bear witness to the birth of a dark new age...!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_700_text": "And age without light, without darkness… and without Star Guardians!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_710_text": "...",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_720_text": "Heh. I can’t wait.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330a_10_text": "Got it, Captain. Can we pick a cool team name?",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330a_20_text": "[“Later! More of those little monsters are swarming all around the giant one!”]",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330a_30_text": "I love fighting those little guys. Put me in, Coach! Chu chu!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330a_40_text": "Right, right, next time! Sona. Tali. Let’s roll.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330a_50_text": "Good luck, you three.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330b_10_text": "By your word, Captain.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330b_20_text": "Oh! Oh, no! Is that your game face?!",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330b_30_text": "What? I’m trying something new. Go fight those smaller monsters, and I’ll practice my “game face” later.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330b_40_text": "Good luck.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330c_10_text": "Curious. I do not feel her presence anywhere.",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330c_20_text": "I have a really bad feeling about this, Captain…",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330c_30_text": "[“We can figure it out later! Right now, there are people to save!”]",
    "chapter_3_act_3_scene_330c_40_text": "Right. Good luck.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_10_text": "Why even resist, children?",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_20_text": "The final battle is approaching anyway. Enjoy this delicious tension.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_30_text": "Besides, what are you going to do? Expose your identities to the public? Endanger your friends and classmates?",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_40_text": "Captain… w-what do we do...?",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_50_text": "Tell me what you’ve done with Akali… or… or I’ll…",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_60_text": "“Or… or I’ll…”",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_70_text": "Mhmhmhm. You’re such a funny little girl. So intent on leading, and yet… you can’t be older than sixteen? Seventeen?",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_80_text": "I’m older than the planet you walk on. Know when to hold your tongue.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_90_text": "I-It’s not like you can fight us here, either! Out in the open like this, you wouldn’t stand a chance...!",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_100_text": "Is that a stutter I hear? How cute. It just makes me want to pinch your cheeks, mhmhm.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_110_text": "Ah, but I need to prepare for class. I think the students are coming along quite nicely, don’t you? They have a certain… darkness within them. It’s quite fun.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_120_text": "They’re so wrapped up in themselves, they’re not even paying attention to this argument! Mhmhmhahaha!",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_120_responseA": "Bring back my friend.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_120_responseB": "The Star Guardians will make you pay for what you’ve done.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_120_responseC": "If you’re as old as the planet, how does your skin stay so vibrant?",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_140_text": "Grrr…! Damn you!",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_150_text": "Still no word from Akali, Captain. She hasn’t been to class in weeks.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_160_text": "Weeks?! A-are we sure she’s okay?",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_170_text": "Valor and I have scouted the entire city, and even some neighboring towns…",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_180_text": "We’ve got nothing to report. She’s gone, Captain. I’m sorry we failed you.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_190_text": "It’s… it’s alright.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_200_text": "You all tried your best. Keep searching, but don’t push yourselves too much.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_210_text": "Part of me thinks… this is all my fault…",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_220_text": "I didn’t listen to her concerns… I didn’t help her when Fiddlesticks attacked… I was just so focused on being a leader, you know?",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_230_text": "Captain…",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_240_text": "[Sigh.]",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_250_text": "It’s okay. I should get back to the search.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_260_text": "During the day, Captain?! You’re going to skip school?!",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_270_text": "Wow, this really is serious...!",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_280_text": "Kai’Sa hasn’t broken a single rule all year… This is big.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_290_text": "Don’t worry about me. I’ll let you know if I find anything.",

    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_400_text": "This is where we first met. Right after I got in a fight with those bullies… you found me right over there in the alley.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_410_text": "You were all scratched up… and soaking wet… and you looked so angry. Like you wanted to murder everyone in the world.",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_420_text": "I was just pissed off. Home life wasn’t great, didn’t have a lot of friends…",
    "chapter_4_act_1_scene_430_text": "Reminds me of Rell, in a way.",

    "akali_2_scene_680_text": "To burn out… to become… something else. Or fade away entirely. Is that what Zoe was? A Star Guardian who fell? She seemed pretty happy about it.",
    "akali_2_scene_690_text": "I want to be a team player, Kai. But you never want to talk about that night. Or what the old guardians actually went through.",
    "akali_2_scene_700_text": "So… sometimes it’s easier for me to imagine what it’s like to fall…",
    "akali_2_scene_710_text": "…than it is for me to imagine doing… that… forever.",
    "akali_2_scene_720_text": "We’re still new at it. Even Lux struggled—",
    "akali_2_scene_730_text": "And Ahri made plenty of mistakes. We met two of them. Actually… did I see Xayah the other day? No, that can’t be right…",
    "akali_2_scene_740_text": "Exactly! We’re just like the old guardians!",
    "akali_2_scene_750_text": "…No, we’re not like the old guardians! Listen to what I’m saying!",

    "akali_3_scene_570_text": "Really?",
    "akali_3_scene_580_text": "Of course. I think about the invasion all the time… Rakan died right in front of us… thousands of people lost their lives… and everyone just… moved on.",
    "akali_3_scene_590_text": "I wonder… is that what it’ll always be? Losing people we care about forever… until we lose each other? Ourselves? It doesn’t seem right. It doesn’t seem… fair.",

    "akali_3_scene_620_text": "Or make friendship bracelets?",

    "akali_3_scene_660_text": "You’ve been talking to old Bill too much. Did he tell you about the five rocks made of problems or whatever?",
    "akali_3_scene_670_text": "The problem rocks! I still don’t know what he was talking about. Maybe I never will.",
    "akali_3_scene_680_text": "Yeah… You know, it’s kinda funny.",

    "akali_3_scene_710_text": "Heh, shut up. It’s all so… overwhelming. And when I’m overwhelmed…",
    "akali_3_scene_720_text": "You make a joke?",
    "akali_3_scene_730_text": "Yeah! A really stupid one. Like, I call a pigeon a sky goblin.",
    "akali_3_scene_740_text": "AHAHAHA! A WHAT?!",
    "akali_3_scene_750_text": "A sky goblin! Because they gobble treasure and tell riddles!",

    "akali_3_scene_790_text": "Ahhh, whew. Hey… whatever happens… let’s just try to be there for each other, okay? You did promise, after all.",

    "akali_3_scene_810_text": "Friends ‘til the end? Even if that end super turbo sucks?",

    "akali_3_scene_530a_20_text": "…I’m not.",
    "akali_3_scene_530a_30_text": "But I know you wouldn’t be doing this if all you cared about was a statue.",
    "akali_3_scene_530a_40_text": "Yeah, I’m more of a billboard person. Captures my image better.",
    "akali_3_scene_530b_10_text": "Yeah… you’re probably right.",
    "akali_3_scene_530b_20_text": "It’s easier if we don’t try to live up to Lux’s standards.",
    "akali_3_scene_530b_30_text": "Yeah, you were right. We can forge our own path.",
    "akali_3_scene_530b_40_text": "I want to be the first Star Guardian with an instant noodle brand. So much sodium your heart explodes right there at the table.",

    "rell_3_scene_70_text": "Heya, K. How’s it hanging?",
    "rell_3_scene_80_text": "It’s going… fine. Were you talking about manga? In public?!",

    "rell_3_scene_120_text": "Right?! We gotta talk about it later. Plus, I just picked up this new manga about a guy who’s sad because he kills everything he touches. It’s awesome.",

    "rell_3_scene_140_text": "Later, Kai’Sa! Okay. One choice, ultimate deathmatch. Gun Goddess or Bullet Angel?",
    "rell_3_scene_150_text": "Come on, this is troll. Gun Goddess’ AI is so much more advanced! It surpasses the Battle Angel chassis’ superior firepower in every way. Get real. Next question.",
    "rell_3_scene_160_text": "… And then Sebastien charged forward with the power of a thousand stars!",

    "nilah_2_scene_230_text": "Many stars shine in the skies above. The First Star is a part of the universe itself… a natural and benevolent light that touches all things.",

    "nilah_2_scene_260_text": "In a sense. Before it was slain, I was tainted by its cosmic joy. I succumbed to it at first, but successfully fought my way back. Now, the power is mine… as is the threat it poses.",

    "nilah_2_scene_450_text": "That is…!",
    "nilah_2_scene_460_text": "Ha! Let your feud go on a little longer. Time and shared trials will do you wonders.",
    "nilah_2_scene_470_text": "Tell me, have you ever faced a monster so titanic it blots out the sky? Or an enemy so insidious that you cannot escape it no matter where you turn?",
    "nilah_2_scene_480_text": "Morgana?",
    "nilah_2_scene_490_text": "Fiddlesticks?",
    "nilah_2_scene_500_text": "Two powerful opponents, but I mean physically large. Gigantic. Epic in scale and ferocity.",
    "nilah_2_scene_510_text": "Uh… not yet… I don’t think...?",
    "nilah_2_scene_520_text": "Excellent!",
    "nilah_2_scene_530_text": "Oh, I don’t like that look.",
    "nilah_2_scene_540_text": "Nilah, what are you planning on doing?! Isn’t that your “excited about giant monsters” face?",
    "nilah_2_scene_550_text": "Is it? I only have the one expression. Nuance sometimes escapes me.",
    "nilah_2_scene_560_text": "I have devised another lesson for your squad—one that will engage me as much as it does you.",
    "nilah_2_scene_570_text": "Wait, no! You can’t lure any giant monsters into the city!",
    "nilah_2_scene_580_text": "Y-yeah! There are some lines even I won’t cross! Hot monsters? Sure. Scary? Definitely. But giant? People could get hurt!",
    "nilah_2_scene_590_text": "Ah, look at the time. I must be off.",
    "nilah_2_scene_600_text": "Nilah! H-hey! This isn’t how we’re supposed to train!",
    "nilah_2_scene_610_text": "We're gonna have to fight a huge monster, aren’t we?",
    "nilah_2_scene_620_text": "I really, really hope not.",
    "nilah_2_scene_150a_10_text": "I did. Kassadin is a good man. You are very lucky to have him.",
    "nilah_2_scene_150b_10_text": "Don’t worry. Your training area is impressively remote, considering the view of the city. Your secrets are safe.",
    "nilah_2_scene_150c_10_text": "I’m sorry, what did you say?",
    "nilah_2_scene_150c_20_text": "If I was physically capable of frowning, I would frown at you. Consider this my smile-frown.",
    "nilah_2_scene_390a_10_text": "Am I a hot star monster, or a scary star monster?",
    "nilah_2_scene_390a_20_text": "Whichever one is more fun for you.",
    "nilah_2_scene_390a_30_text": "I choose both.",
    "nilah_2_scene_390b_10_text": "Always? That’s funny. You’re very funny.",
    "nilah_2_scene_390b_20_text": "What? Is that not how we’re supposed to operate?",
    "nilah_2_scene_390b_30_text": "Not even a little. Star Guardian recruits are almost always teenagers. Insubordination… Drama… It all comes with the territory.",
    "nilah_2_scene_390c_10_text": "I don’t understand. Do you need another father figure? You have an actual father.",
    "nilah_2_scene_390c_20_text": "She’s desperate for Lux’s approval, and you’ve talked to Lux at least once. It’s this weird mentor-student thing.",
    "nilah_2_scene_390c_30_text": "N-n-no! You don’t understand...!",
    "nilah_2_scene_390c_40_text": "That explains all this… Star Guardian merchandise?! I have some uncomfortable questions about the state of this planet.",
    "chapter_4_act_3_scene_10_text": "Look at this quiet little city… everyone going about their day… living their lives, chasing their dreams…",

    "chapter_4_act_3_scene_70_text": "What do we do?! They’re moving too fast...! A… aaghhh!",
    "chapter_4_act_3_scene_80_text": "Justice is a lie… Order is the chain of the wicked master…",
