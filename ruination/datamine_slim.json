        "Narrator: [Two figures emerge from the boat.]",
        "Lucian: What’s happened to the headquarters? Place barely has a roof on it.",
        "Senna: Where are all the other sentinels? Who’s your commanding officer?",
        "Lucian: You mean to tell me we sailed halfway across the ocean to recruit one damn sentinel?",
        "Senna: You better be the best damn sentinel in history. How many years of experience do you have?",
        "Lucian: Are you kidding me? The kid’s a rookie?! Of all the rotten luck…",
        "Senna: Listen, Rookie. Just over the horizon there is a cloud of evil bigger than anyone’s ever seen.",
        "Senna: A Harrowing that could end the world. In other words...",
        "Lucian: Stuff’s about to get real ugly.",
        "Senna: So if you don’t want the world to die, I’m going to need you to dig deep and find some veteran skills in that rookie head of yours. Understand?",
        "Narrator: [At that moment, a distant cacophony of low rumbling and tormented shrieks sends chills down your spine.]",
        "Narrator: [You look out over the ocean to see a massive cloud of Black Mist filling the sky, spreading toward you at a rapid pace.]",
        "Senna: It’s here.",
        "Lucian: Lock ‘n’ load, Rookie! You know how to shoot, right?",
        "Lucian: Oh, ain’t that… perfect. I’m so glad we wasted all that time sailing here.",
        "Senna: No time for griping, Lucian. We’ve got a fight on our hands.",
        "Narrator: [In an instant, a dark cloud of wraiths engulfs the beach.]",
        "Senna: Rookie—you can help by… well…",

        "Narrator: [You and your new sentinel friends must fight to survive.]",
        "Senna: Thank the gods. We’re in the right place.",
        "Lucian: Good. Not sure this boat would’ve made it much further.",
        "Lucian: I was going to say we need your help, but from the look of it, you don’t have much to give.",
        "Lucian: Whoa! Easy there, kid.",
        "Senna: We’re sentinels. I’m Senna. He’s Lucian.",

        "Senna: When I fired my gun, she wasn’t calming my nerves.",

        "Lucian: You’re alive. And that’s what’s important.",
        "Senna: For how much longer, Lucian?",
        "Senna: All those years in Thresh’s lantern, she was the only thing protecting me—the only reason I survived.",
        "Lucian: No. It was you. And me. Fighting together.",
        "Lucian: And we can damn sure get along without some creepy ghost queen whispering in your ear.",

        "Lucian: Another wraith. And it looks like it’s fighting someone!",

        "Gwen: Snip, snip! Back to the shadows you go!",
        "Gwen: Hello, all. Sorry for the noise. They do scream ever so loudly when you snip them.",
        "Lucian: How did you…? Who are you?",
        "Gwen: Quite rude of me. My name is Gwen. I sew things.",
        "Senna: Sewing, huh? Is that what that was?",
        "Gwen: This world is but a fabric, and the Black Mist is its frayed seams. So I stitch it up!",
        "Lucian: How’d you do that? I thought only sentinel weapons could put a wraith down for good.",
        "Gwen: A needle and thread to bind the undead. The Hallowed Seamstress is here to assist, good sentinels.",
        "Senna: Lucian, her needle and scissors? They seem like relic weapons. Like our guns.",
        "Senna: And that’s not all. There’s something... strange about her. Odd, but familiar.",
        "Senna: What… is she?",
        "Lucian: No idea. What do you think, Rook? Should we trust Miss Scissors here?",
        "Senna: As long as those scissors keep killing wraiths, I say we keep ‘em around.",
        "Lucian: You can stay, Scissors.",
        "Gwen: Oh, delightful! I’m sure we’ll get along splendidly!",
        "Gwen: What say we start our new friendship by killing more wraiths?",
        "Senna: More wraiths?",
        "Gwen: Indeed. There’s a whole storm of them coming ashore right now!",
        "Lucian: Ah, hells. That’s even more than last time.",
        "Senna: This looks grim. If this is how we’re going out… It was an honor fighting with you all.",
        "Gwen: Now hold on. There’s no need for farewells just yet. I’ve got just the thing...",
        "Gwen: A protective garment made of Hallowed Mist! To guard against the servants of the Ruined King!",
        "Narrator: [You watch in astonishment as Gwen envelopes you in a shroud of shimmering silvery-blue Mist. The wraiths pass by, appearing not to notice you.]",
        "Gwen: Fits perfectly, if I do say so myself.",
        "Senna: They can’t see us.",
        "Lucian: I don’t believe it. This is pure Hallowed Mist! The only thing a Harrowing can’t touch.",
        "Lucian: Scissors, you keep surprising me.",
        "Senna: This is our chance. Let’s make a run for the headquarters!",
        "Lucian: Oh, boy. You’ve got a lot to learn, kid.",
        "Lucian: Did your mentor teach you ANYTHING?",
        "Senna: Go easy, Lucian. I remember when you didn’t know everything.",
        "Senna: That, young Rookie, was the work of Viego, the Ruined King.",
        "Lucian: You might say we’ve got a history with him.",
        "Senna: Ah, I see someone paid attention in training.",
        "Lucian: Check out the booksmarts on Rookie.",
        "Senna: Yes, that was the work of Viego, the Ruined King.",
        "Lucian: You might say we’ve got a history with him.",
        "Senna: Ah, I see someone paid attention in training.",
        "Lucian: Check out the booksmarts on Rookie.",
        "Senna: Yes, that was the work of Viego, the Ruined King.",
        "Lucian: You might say we’ve got a history with him.",
        "Lucian: It was nobody, Rookie.",
        "Senna: She wasn’t a nobody. She was the Queen of Camavor. Viego’s wife.",
        "Senna: I didn’t always know it, but… she looked out for me.",
        "Lucian: She was a curse, Senna. A spirit that haunted you. And you’re better off without her.",
        "Senna: Who are you to decide that, Lucian?",
        "Senna: She was the Queen of Camavor.",
        "Senna: I didn’t always know it, but… she looked out for me.",
        "Senna: And now, I’m alone.",
        "Lucian: Alone? What are you talking about? You’ve got me! Uh, and Rookie!",
        "Senna: Hmm. That makes sense. The enemy of my enemy and all that.",
        "Lucian: You’re keeping a level head, Rookie. I like it.",
        "Lucian: I asked for your opinion.",
        "Lucian: If I wanted you to stand there and act dumb, I wouldn’t have said anything.",
        "Senna: What he means is—you’re going to have to step up a little, Rookie. Assert yourself.",
        "Lucian: So you’re scared. I don’t blame you.",
        "Lucian: But you’re gonna see a lot more than giant scissors in this job, kid.",
        "Lucian: Best get used to it.",
        "Narrator: [Threatened by a massive Harrowing, the sentinels have taken refuge in the old headquarters.]",
        "Gwen: See there? We made it. Safe in the tidy confines of—",
        "Gwen: Oh my. This place needs a lot of stitching.",
        "Senna: It’s seen better days, for sure. Rookie, how are you stocked on supplies?",
        "Senna: Okay. Looks like we’ll be roughing it tonight then. Everyone, find a spot on the floor and settle in.",
        "Senna: Tomorrow, we fix the boat and try to rein in that Black Mist. ...Somehow.",
        "Narrator: [You move to your cot into the corner of the room...]",
        "Narrator: [But your rest is interrupted by a startling sight.]",
        "Narrator: [An old stone tablet in the back of the room begins to flicker with a magical glow…]",
        "Narrator: [And an unfamiliar face appears, projected by magic.]",
        "Buhru Sentinel: Hello? Headquarters, this is the Serpent Isles base. Can you hear me?",
        "Lucian: What the many hells is that?!",
        "Buhru Sentinel: This is the Serpent Isles sentinel base. I’ve activated your communications portal.",
        "Buhru Sentinel: The situation is most dire. The Black Mist...",
        "Senna: We’ve been dealing with it out here, too. How far has it spread?",
        "Buhru Sentinel: Everywhere.",
        "Buhru Sentinel: We’ve been following its progress on the Worldstone...",
        "Buhru Sentinel: In all my years, I’ve never seen a Harrowing like this. It moves quickly, with purpose, covering entire continents overnight.",
        "Buhru Sentinel: We’re holding our ground in the Serpent Isles, but... I can’t say how much longer we’ll last.",
        "Gwen: Where is the Ruined King? If I can just find him, I’ll snip him into so many pieces...",
        "Buhru Sentinel: I’m afraid it’s not that simple. Viego travels through the Mist in the blink of an eye, moving across the world at will.",
        "Buhru Sentinel: You must leave immediately and take the fight to his Black Mist. Your nearest region is Demacia. It’s as good a place to start as any.",
        "Lucian: Demacia? That’s a thousand leagues away! Even if we fix our boat, it’ll take months to—",
        "Buhru Sentinel: I see you know little of the secrets of our order. Touch Demacia on the Worldstone map.",
        "Narrator: [Lucian’s finger finds Demacia on the map. A beam of magical light shines from it, illuminating everyone in the room.]",
        "Buhru Sentinel: This enchanted map can instantly transport you to any sentinel base in Runeterra.",
        "Buhru Sentinel: You must visit every region, cleanse them of Viego’s influence…",
        "Buhru Sentinel: And if possible, recruit worthy soldiers to our cause.",
        "Senna: Hmm. Looks like we’ve got our work cut out for us. What do you say, Rookie? You ready to see the world?",
        "Lucian: You know what? It doesn’t matter what Rookie thinks. The kid ain’t coming.",
        "Senna: Come on, Lucian. You heard the sentinel. We need recruits.",
        "Lucian: Experienced recruits. We can’t be babysittin’ some greenhorn when we’ve got a world to save.",
        "Lucian: Now, Scissors over here... She’s earned it. Welcome aboard, Scissors.",
        "Gwen: Marvelous! I shall sew joy into every seam of this world! Viego will have no refuge!",
        "Buhru Sentinel: There’s just one more thing you’ll need. Your headquarters should be equipped with a Wayfinder. It looks like this.",
        "Narrator: [A holographic image of your gun appears on the tablet.]",
        "Buhru Sentinel: It’s your ticket back to headquarters. You can activate it anywhere in the world, and it will teleport you home.",
        "Senna: That looks like your gun, Rookie. I guess we know what it does now.",
        "Lucian: Well, you heard the man, Rook. Looks like I’m gonna need you to hand that Wayfinder over. You weren’t using it anyway.",
        "Buhru Sentinel: I’m afraid that won’t work. The Wayfinder can only be used by the sentinel to whom it was bound.",
        "Lucian: Oh, no. Let me guess…",
        "Lucian: Just get your bag, Rook.",
        "Lucian: And don’t get too comfortable. I got my eye on you.",
        "Narrator: [Lucian touches the Worldstone again.]",
        "Narrator: [With a flash of magical light, you and the sentinels are teleported from headquarters...]",
        "Narrator: [You arrive in Demacia to find that little remains of the old sentinel base.]",
        "Narrator: [Beneath your feet is a sentinel glyph carved into the limestone landing. It glows softly on your arrival.]",
        "Narrator: [Before you, the entire city of Demacia lies shrouded in Black Mist. The shrieks of wraiths and the cries of the living come from just inside the gates.]",
        "Senna: Damn. Guess the sentinel base is long gone.",
        "Lucian: Looks like there might not be much left of the city either.",
        "Lucian: At least, nothing that’s not ruined.",
        "Senna: Sorry, babe. Not the homecoming you were hoping for.",
        "Senna: But first, we’ve got to get the lay of the land here.",
        "Senna: Lucian, where’s a good place to go to get some intelligence?",
        "Lucian: Hmm. There used to be an old tavern up here just inside the gates.",
        "Gwen: A tavern? Really, Lucian. Isn’t it customary to toast after the battle?",
        "Lucian: Place was always full of salty ol’ sailors and mercenaries. If anyone can tell us anything about what’s happened around here, that’ll be the place to find ‘em.",
        "Senna: Worth a try.",
        "Senna: That’s… not optimal. But it’ll have to do.",
        "Lucian: I’ve had canned sturgeon. It’s not bad on crackers.",
        "Lucian: You messing with me, kid? Keep it up, and see where it gets ya.",
        "Senna: That’s… not optimal. But it’ll have to do.",
        "Lucian: Hell, I’d eat a sand snail. How bad could they be?",
        "Lucian: This ain’t the way to treat company, Rook.",
        "Senna: Seriously?",
        "Lucian: No. Rook's joking.",
        "Lucian: The kid's having some fun at our expense.",
        "Lucian: Sorry won’t get us anything, Rook.",
        "Lucian: The Mist doesn’t care how sorry you are. Neither does Viego.",
        "Lucian: All they’re gonna understand is the light from a gun barrel.",
        "Lucian: I’ll tell you what now. We go in guns blazing and purify this place.",
        "Senna: Stay close, Rookie. You’re about to earn your first stripe.",
        "Lucian: Look at you, all rarin’ to go.",
        "Senna: Don’t tease the kid, babe. I remember when my spirit wasn’t broken yet.",
        "Senna: You’ll see plenty of action soon enough, Rookie.",
        "Narrator: [After sneaking your way past throngs of Mist wraiths, you arrive at a lowly tavern near the edge of the city.]",
        "Lucian: This is it. The Singing Swan. Looks even worse than the last time I was here.",
        "Gwen: Someone ought to have a talk with the owner. Appearances do matter, even to the weariest traveler.",
        "Senna: I don’t care if the roof’s caving in. Let’s get inside before these wraiths notice us.",
        "Narrator: [You try the door of the tavern but find it locked up tight.]",
        "Narrator: [You knock firmly. A WOMAN’S VOICE answers curtly from inside.]",
        "???: Yeah?",
        "???: How do I know that?",
        "Senna: I could blow the door off the hinges. That might prove it.",
        "Narrator: [The door is flung open. A hand pulls you inside and slams the door behind you, barring it shut.]",
        "Vayne: Sorry about that. You can’t be too careful right now.",
        "Vayne: Those things are everywhere.",
        "Vayne: Some of them talk, too. You don’t know they’re not normal until it’s too late.",
        "Lucian: You sound like you've been through all of the hells tonight.",
        "Vayne: Got that right. Lost most of our guard to those monsters.",
        "Vayne: I don’t think I managed to kill a single one.",
        "Vayne: They keep getting back up.",
        "Senna: It’s your crossbow. It’s not made for killing wraiths.",
        "Vayne: What are you talking about? This baby’s loaded with prime silver bolts. More than enough for any monster.",
        "Vayne: Who’s the know-it-all?",
        "Lucian: New sentinel. A rookie.",
        "Lucian: We’ve been calling ‘em “Rookie.”",
        "Vayne: Clever.",
        "Vayne: Listen, Rookie… I’ve been hunting magical creatures my whole life. I lost everything to them... Hate them with every ounce of my being.",
        "Vayne: Do you really think I don’t know how to kill them?",
        "Senna: Rookie’s right. These wraiths are the servants of the Ruined King. Only sentinel weapons can end them.",
        "Lucian: Got a couple extras back at headquarters. If you’re interested, I could swear you in and get you a relic gun of your own.",
        "Vayne: Save it. I kill magical creatures. Not trying to be one.",
        "Senna: Uh-huh. Well, I think we’ve gotten all the intelligence we’re going to get out of this place.",
        "Vayne: Wait…",
        "Vayne: Maybe we should team up. We all hate monsters. I know the city…",
        "Lucian: Let me guess. You don’t wanna die alone in here?",
        "Vayne: What kind of coward do you take me for?",
        "Narrator: [Through Vayne’s tough façade, you can hear the faintest tinge of fear in her voice.]",
        "Senna: You can come along. But you should know we’re only going deeper into danger.",
        "Senna: We need to find the heart of this Harrowing.",
        "Vayne: You mean the mageseeker compound?",
        "Senna: Mageseeker compound?",
        "Vayne: That’s where the worst of this stuff is happening. It’s almost like it’s all flowing toward the building.",
        "Senna: What goes on in there?",
        "Vayne: It’s where the mageseekers keep the magical items they confiscate.",
        "Lucian: Sounds like Viego’s looking for something magical. And powerful.",
        "Senna: Just like what he took from me.",
        "Lucian: I don’t like that look in your eye. Maybe you going into the heart of this ain’t the best way to—",
        "Senna: Let’s head out, sentinels. On my count.",
        "Senna: One… two…",
        "Senna: ...three!",
        "Narrator: [With your sentinel comrades at your side, you charge out the door of the tavern, into the fray of the Harrowing.]",
        "Vayne: Just messing with you, Rookie. No one’s gonna hurt you.",
        "Vayne: ...Unless you’re a monster. You’re not a monster are you?",
        "Vayne: Like I said, no one’s gonna hurt you.",
        "Narrator: [You and the sentinels arrive at the mageseeker compound. Black Mist pours into every door and window of the complex.]",
        "Lucian: This is it. Whatever Viego is looking for, it’s within those walls.",
        "Senna: Brace yourselves. We don’t know exactly what we’re walking into.",
        "Senna: Rookie, keep your hand on that Wayfinder. But don’t trigger it unless I say so. Got it?",
        "Senna: Great. Everybody on board? On my count, we charge in. Ready?",
        "Senna: One…",
        "Senna: Two...",
        "Senna: Thr—",
        "Shyvana: Sentinels! Why… Why have you come here?",
        "Senna: We’re here to end the Harrowing and liberate Demacia from the Black Mist. Who are you?",
        "Vayne: Shyvana.",
        "Vayne: Be careful with this one, Senna. She’s more monstrous than she appears.",
        "Shyvana: Yes. Monstrous… The reason for all the suffering. Pain inflicted by my own kingdom.",
        "Shyvana: So many have suffered here, for so long. Simply for being different.",
        "Shyvana: Perhaps it is best if this place is harrowed to its core. Perhaps a ruined Demacia would be an improvement.",
        "Lucian: You’re insane.",
        "Gwen: Oh my! Her hue is changing! To a most unbecoming shade of green.",
        "Senna: She’s becoming ruined. She’s giving in to the Mist!",
        "Vayne: Say the word, and I’ll put one right between her eyes.",
        "Shyvana: More threats... They fear us. They threaten and maim...",
        "Shyvana: They banish us. Keep us in cages…",
        "Shyvana: Not anymore.",
        "Narrator: [Shyvana shakes the surrounding walls of the mageseeker compound. Heavy pieces of petricite brick begin to fall.]",
        "Gwen: Oh my! This is most impolite!",
        "Narrator: [Within seconds, you and the other sentinels are buried in rubble.]",
        "Lucian: [cough] Is everyone okay?! Senna?!",
        "Senna: Get these rocks off me and I’ll be better. I can’t move. Rookie, you with us?",
        "Senna: Can anyone move at all? ...Gwen?",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Gwen: But my scissors are dandy.",
        "Narrator: [Gwen’s scissors hover freely in the air, awaiting her command.]",
        "Senna: See if you can cut us out of here!",
        "Gwen: Snip snip! Away with these dusty old bricks!",
        "Narrator: [Gwen’s scissors begin snipping away at the rubble.]",
        "Narrator: [Piece by piece, the rubble disappears, until the sentinels are free.]",
        "Lucian: Nice chopping, Scissors. You wield a mean pair of blades.",
        "Vayne: Where’s the beast woman? I’ve got a score to settle.",
        "Senna: Save that anger. You’re going to need it for whatever’s inside this building.",
        "Senna: Ready, sentinels?",

        "Senna: Can you reach your Wayfinder?",
        "Vayne: That’s it. I’m slapping that kid. As soon as I get my arm free.",
        "Lucian: Vayne, do not slap our rookie.",
        "Lucian: Rookie, remember what you signed up for. Sentinels run toward the Harrowing. We don’t hide from it.",

        "Lucian: Here we are. The mageseeker vaults.",
        "Lucian: I figure whatever Viego is looking for is in the middle of this Black Mist cloud.",
        "Senna: This is it, sentinels. Into the darkness!",
        "Narrator: [With the other sentinels at your side, you charge into the black core of Demacia’s Harrowing.]",

        "Narrator: [From out of the Black Mist cloud, a figure materializes.]",
        "Viego: Ah, sentinels. We meet again. In this, a prison for magic, no less.",
        "Viego: Don’t they know true love cannot be sundered by lock or cage?",
        "Gwen: No… It’s him... Viego. (Mustn’t let him see us!)",
        "Narrator: [Gwen conjures her Hallowed Mist shroud, concealing herself from Viego.]",
        "Lucian: What do you want from Demacia?",
        "Viego: Only what is mine...",

        "Narrator: [...and floats through the air to Viego’s hand.]",
        "Viego: What I have crossed the realms to rebuild.",
        "Vayne: You came back from the dead for some old mirror? Why?",
        "Senna: He seems to be in the habit of taking things he thinks are his.",
        "Senna: Why did you take her from me? She… She was my guide.",
        "Viego: You speak as if you knew her.",
        "Senna: She was as much a part of me as anything. You had no right...",
        "Viego: You know nothing of my queen!",
        "Viego: There are many facets to her. Many parts of her persona, known to no one but me.",
        "Narrator: [He glances at the mirror in his hand. It glows with a pale, green light.]",
        "Senna: [A tiny spec of light begins to glow in Senna’s chest, flickering in unison with the glow of the mirror.]",

        "Viego: No matter. I will reclaim every last bit of my beloved queen.",

        "Gwen: Nooo! Leave her be, you villain!",
        "Narrator: [Gwen pulls Senna into her Hallowed Mist shroud, making her undetectable to Viego.]",
        "Viego: Where is she? I can’t feel her! What have you done with her?!",

        "Senna: But I have to stop him!",
        "Gwen: No, Miss. Not like this.",
        "Viego: You there. New sentinel. You can perform a great service for the King of Camavor today…",
        "Viego: By telling me where your leader is hiding.",
        "Viego: Insolence! You are but another enemy of our union. Another foe of our bliss. I will remember your face.",

        "Narrator: [The sentinels unleash a hail of gunlight. Each shot chips away a small amount of Black Mist but does little to harm Viego.]",
        "Viego: You would deny me happiness? Lock it away, like the magics in this vault?",
        "Viego: Then you will perish beneath its weight.",

        "Gwen: I was protecting you from him, Miss.",
        "Senna: You were holding me back! I was meant to fight him!",
        "Gwen: No… I couldn’t let him see. We can’t let him take what’s left of her.",
        "Senna: What’s left of “her?” You mean the Queen? The one whose spirit lives inside me?",
        "Senna: How do you know about her? What does that have to do with you?",
        "Gwen: ...",
        "Senna: Because of your interference, Viego got away.",
        "Senna: Let’s spread out, see if we can find his trail.",
        "Lucian: Senna—wait.",
        "Lucian: Maybe Gwen was right. If Viego wants what you’ve got, maybe it’s best if you stay hidden. Let us—",
        "Senna: Don’t even say it, Lucian. I’m doing this.",
        "Lucian: Rookie, back me up here.",
        "Vayne: There’s the monster! Viego’s heading down that street!",
        "Lucian: I see him! In that patch of Mist!",
        "Narrator: [You turn to see Viego, darting toward the gates of the mageseeker compound.]",
        "Senna: After him! Whatever he stole from the vault, we can’t let him leave with it!",
        "Narrator: [You pursue Viego through the courtyard, but he remains one step ahead, darting through the Mist clouds at incredible speed.]",
        "Narrator: [Just when you gain ground, Viego disappears again. A second later, he reappears in a patch of Mist, just outside the courtyard.]",
        "Lucian: This ain’t working. He’s too fast in this Mist!",
        "Senna: Maybe I can cut off his path.",
        "Narrator: [Senna fires her gun, taking out a large piece of the Black Mist, thwarting Viego’s exit.]",
        "Senna: There. Now he’s got nowhere to go!",

        "Shyvana: [ROAAAAR]",
        "Shyvana: So… You like fighting monsters, do you, Vayne?",
        "Shyvana: Now’s your chance!",
        "Senna: Uh, Vayne? Did you forget to tell us she can turn into a dragon?",
        "Narrator: [Lucian and Senna both give you long, uncomfortable stares. Neither is happy with you, but neither is angry at you.]",
        "Senna: Excuse me?",
        "Senna: Last time I checked, I was the one who gives the orders, and you were the one fresh out of training.",
        "Senna: So maybe start acting like it. Got me?",
        "Lucian: Rook’s just looking out for you, darlin’.",
        "Senna: Smart. You may be a rookie, but you’re a fast learner.",
        "Lucian: Thanks, Rook. Remember this when she ends up dead.",
        "Narrator: [After a grueling fight, you and the sentinels finally manage to bring down Shyvana.]",
        "Lucian: That’s how you do it. Good shootin’, folks.",
        "Narrator: [Though still ruined, her strength is gone. You watch as she fades back into her human form.]",

        "Vayne: No. She’s still kicking.",

        "Senna: Don’t. It’s not right.",
        "Gwen: Agreed. She doesn’t look half as terrible now. I almost feel… pity for her.",
        "Vayne: Pity? Have you people lost your minds?",
        "Vayne: That’s a murderous fire-breathing hellbeast in front you. One minute ago, she was trying to roast you alive!",
        "Vayne: Take it from me, if you get these things down, it’s best to finish the job.",
        "Vayne: Never leave a monster alive.",
        "Lucian: She said stand down, Vayne.",
        "Senna: Shyvana didn’t know what she was doing. She’s under the influence of the Black Mist.",
        "Senna: We can lock her in the mageseeker dungeon until she returns to normal.",
        "Vayne: She’ll never be normal.",
        "Vayne: What do you say, Rookie? You want to let this monster live?",
        "Lucian: Now, where’d Viego get off to?",

        "Vayne: Wait...",
        "Vayne: Suppose you find this guy? Then what?",
        "Vayne: You must’ve fired a hundred shots at him today, and barely made a dent.",
        "Senna: We’ll figure it out.",
        "Vayne: You’ll die. Face it—you might know Harrowings, but I know monsters.",
        "Vayne: And I know every one of them’s got a weak spot. Even this guy.",
        "Lucian: Sounds to me like you’re volunteering.",
        "Vayne: That depends.",
        "Vayne: Those fancy magical weapons you people use…",

        "Senna: Lucian, are you sure about this? This woman seems a little… eager.",
        "Lucian: We need all the help we can get. Don’t you think so, Rookie?",
        "Senna: Good. Well, Vayne… welcome aboard. Are you sure you’re ready to be a sentinel?",
        "Vayne: Are you sure the sentinels are ready for me?",

        "Miss Fortune: Lucian?! I was just talking about you!",
        "Miss Fortune: I take it this is your crew?",
        "Lucian: Yep. Could you kindly refrain from killin’ ‘em? We’re about to need every gun we’ve got.",
        "Narrator: [Sarah Fortune lowers her pistols from Graves’s face.]",
        "Senna: Lucian. You know this woman?",
        "Lucian: Yeah, remember? I told you about that time I was on a boat with Olaf?",
        "Lucian: Well, Sarah was there, too. And we ran into Hecarim…",
        "Senna: Hecarim?! When did you meet him?",
        "Lucian: It’s a really long story with a lot of characters, darlin’. Can we talk about it later?",
        "Senna: What else are you hiding from me?",
        "Narrator: [You and Lucian exchange worried looks.]",
        "Lucian: Uhhh—",
        "Lucian: The important thing is that I found out Viego is already here.",
        "Miss Fortune: Viego?! He’s back in Bilgewater?",
        "Miss Fortune: (As if I didn’t have enough to worry about with Gangplank...)",
        "Miss Fortune: What does he want here?",
        "Senna: We believe he’s looking for something of great importance to him. Something on board your ship.",
        "Vayne: Did you pick up any loot recently?",
        "Miss Fortune: Does a fish breathe water?",
        "Miss Fortune: Rafen! Bring out the last haul!",

        "Miss Fortune: Fetter?",
        "Lucian: A piece of the Ruined Queen’s soul. This is what Viego’s tearin’ up the world to find.",
        "Miss Fortune: So… the Ruined King misses his wife. How romantic. And how desperate.",
        "Miss Fortune: (...Maybe desperate enough to give me what I want.)",
        "Miss Fortune: Rafen! Lower the brow. I’m going ashore.",
        "Senna: What are you doing?",
        "Miss Fortune: Going to find our ruined friend. I believe he and I have business to discuss.",

        "Narrator: [Before she can be reasoned with, Miss Fortune grabs the fetter and exits the ship.]",
        "Senna: Well, Lucian, your old sailing buddy has just taken the fetter and left to find Viego. You got anything to say?",
        "Lucian: We gotta talk some sense into her. Come on.",

        "Graves: Somethin’s happened to her.",
        "Graves: Sarah Fortune has always been the most ruthless, connivin’, backstabbin’est cutthroat in the whole damn isles…",
        "Graves: ...but now she seems like she’s… gone wrong.",
        "Lucian: Yeah. She does seem a little off her rocker. Things must’ve gotten real bad between her and this Gangplank fella.",

        "Miss Fortune: How much I’ve lost? How many times I’ve nearly found myself dead at the bottom of the bay…?",
        "Miss Fortune: And here the Ruined King drops his anchor in my harbor, and I’m supposed to ignore the opportunity?",
        "Miss Fortune: This whole war. This power struggle with Gangplank... I could end it today.",
        "Vayne: Bad idea. Never deal with monsters. Especially this monster.",
        "Miss Fortune: You’re wrong. I know what he’s capable of. And I can use him.",
        "Olaf: He cannot be used! I’ve chased him and his shadow lord across the world, hoping for a glorious death.",
        "Olaf: They’ve not even granted me that!",
        "Miss Fortune: ...",
        "Diana: It is true. Viego’s power is greater than the heavens themselves. Everyone he encounters, he ruins.",

        "Lucian: Losing? The sentinels have been putting down Harrowings for a thousand years! What makes you think we’re gonna lose?",
        "Miss Fortune: Don’t take it personally, Lucian. You sure you know which way the winds are blowing?",
        "Senna: Yes. We do.",
        "Senna: Unless Isolde has been lying to me this whole time, I know it’s our destiny to confront Viego and end his reign.",
        "Senna: Make it your destiny, Sarah. Fight Viego with the sentinels. Be on the right side.",
        "Miss Fortune: And if we win… what? I get to come back here and deal with Gangplank? Doesn’t sound like such a rosy ending.",
        "Irelia: If you free Bilgewater from this Harrowing, everyone here will respect you.",
        "Irelia: They will know your strength, and they will follow you to the world’s end. People will speak your name in reverent tones for ages, and your rivals will fade into obscurity and disgrace.",
        "Riven: Damn, that was pretty good. You actually had ME inspired for a second.",
        "Irelia: Do not speak to me.",
        "Riven: Fine. (...Didn’t wanna talk to you anyway.)",
        "Narrator: [Miss Fortune pauses, contemplating her options.]",
        "Miss Fortune: You all make a convincing case.",
        "Miss Fortune: And even though I don’t think you stand a chance in hell, I’m willing to see how this plays out.",
        "Miss Fortune: If you can take out the Ruined King, the fetter is yours.",
        "Riven: I mean, you could give it to us now. That’s probably the safe move.",
        "Miss Fortune: I’ll hold the treasure for now. Because if you don’t take out the Ruined King…",

        "Lucian: Uh-huh. Excuse us a second, Sarah.",
        "Lucian: What do y’all think? She seems a far cry from the Sarah I knew. Can’t say if she’ll come through on this or not.",

        "Senna: We’ll find Viego, fight him, and win. But when we do…",
        "Senna: ...I’m holding you to your end of the bargain.",
        "Senna: Now for the matter of finding him…",

        "Narrator: [You get a strong whiff of rotting fish, and the foul, musty scent of Harrowing.]",
        "Senna: Down there. In the Slaughter Docks.",
        "Senna: That’s his trail.",
        "Graves: You do that and you’ll have twenty goons comin’ outta the woodwork to cave your head in, kid.",
        "Graves: Don’t be fooled. Sarah Fortune don’t never sail alone.",
        "Graves: I gotta admit, I wouldn’t sit with my back turned to her.",

        "Lucian: Lots of Mist, lots of screams. This is the way to Viego alright.",
        "Gwen: What is this squishiness I keep stepping in?",
        "Graves: That’d be fish guts, little lady.",
        "Graves: They don’t call ‘em the Slaughter Docks for nothin’.",
        "Gwen: Oh my, I’m going to… what do people call it? Vomit?",
        "Gwen: Yes, that’s it—I’m going to vomit!",
        "Graves: I was about to say: Even though the idea of walkin’ ankle deep in fish parts may not seem appealin’ to some people...",
        "Graves: ...this neighborhood has some of the best waterin' holes in Bilgewater. Secret spots that only us locals know about.",
        "Vayne: Was that directed at me? If so, hard pass.",
        "Senna: No time for a tour, Graves. I think we’ve got wraiths ahead. A lot of ‘em.",
        "Rengar: There is something else, too. Something that lurks in the shadows and hunts with much tenacity.",
        "Narrator: [Rengar opens his mouth and grimaces, as he tastes something foul on the air.]",
        "Rengar: It reeks of… seawater. And death.",
        "Riven: Sounds like a party. Let’s go.",
        "Narrator: [You take a few steps, and stop abruptly as a crazed, salt-worn voice comes from within the Mist.]",
        "???: To the deep with you!",
        "Vayne: Oh, that is definitely a monster.",
        "Narrator: [Vayne aims her crossbow at the crazed figure, but before she can shoot, the figure leaps away with its knives drawn… ]",

        "Narrator: [With supernatural precision, the figure attacks the wraith with three rapid slashes from his blades.]",
        "Narrator: [Though his knives have no effect, the crazed figure leaps to another wraith, continuing his attack unabated.]",
        "Pyke: Salt in the eyes of the Harrowing!",
        "Vayne: Gods above, what kind of psycho is this guy?",
        "Riven: Someone who hates the Harrowing apparently. Or salt? I can’t tell.",
        "Graves: Goes by the name of Pyke. Never seen him up close before.",
        "Graves: Truth be told, I always thought he was just a ghost story parents told to make children behave.",
        "Pyke: Are you on my list, too?",
        "Pyke: Indeed you are! Float ‘til you sink!",
        "Narrator: [Pyke lunges at yet another wraith, stabbing through it to no effect, and quickly moves on to another specter.]",

        "Narrator: [Moments later, Pyke emerges unscathed.]",
        "Lucian: Creepy bastard can take a hit! He just came out of a swarm of wraiths and didn’t have a scratch on him!",
        "Pyke: Sink ‘til you float! I will have my revenge!",
        "Diana: Hmm. This creature seems to carry some vendetta.",
        "Diana: But only against these wraiths. Does he harbor some grudge against Viego?",
        "Narrator: [For the first time, Pyke turns his attention to the sentinels.]",
        "Pyke: Viego? Yes, Viego! Are you Viego? If so, you will breathe the brine!",

        "Lucian: Rookie—SAY NO.",
        "Pyke: You cut my line? What is your name, line cutter?",
        "Vayne: Oh, can we please just shoot this thing already?",
        "Diana: No. Wait...",
        "Diana: There is some power at work within him. I sense he may serve a purpose here, for the good.",

        "Riven: Ugh. Not that name.",
        "Pyke: Yes. You are on my list. You cut my line!",
        "Pyke: You are… not on my list?",
        "Lucian: Nope. Kid’s in the clear. Never cut a line in their life.",
        "Vayne: If we’re not going to kill this thing, can we just move on?!",
        "Vayne: If I figure correctly, Viego went somewhere in this direction...",
        "Narrator: [Vayne points toward a warehouse at the end of the Slaughter Docks, where the majority of the Black Mist seems to be originating.]",
        "Narrator: At that very moment, a massive throng of wraiths comes shrieking out of the warehouse, ruining everything in their path as they rush toward you.]",
        "Irelia: Our path is fraught with peril. We cannot possibly withstand so many wraiths.",
        "Senna: Lucky for us, we know someone who can.",
        "Senna: Pyke? That’s your name, right?",
        "Pyke: Yes. Pyke. Harpooner of The Terror. Were you on my crew?",
        "Pyke: If so, you are on my list!",
        "Senna: We are Sentinels of Light, and we have a list of our own.",
        "Senna: And if I’m not mistaken, both of our lists share a name.",
        "Pyke: Viego? The Ruined King? I’ll put my harpoon through his heart!",
        "Senna: That’s the guy. We’re on our way now, to give him a... harpooning.",
        "Pyke: I will harpoon him! I will watch him sink as his lungs fill with the sea!",
        "Senna: Okay, okay. But in order for that to happen… I’m gonna need you to take on those wraiths for us. Can you do that?",
        "Narrator: [Pyke turns and surveys the throng of wraiths heading straight toward you.]",
        "Pyke: Wraiths… Wraiths are on my list.",
        "Narrator: [With astonishing speed and purpose, Pyke lunges into the press of wraiths, absorbing their attacks without flinching.]",
        "Senna: There. That oughta keep them occupied...",
        "Narrator: [With the wraiths focused on Pyke, a clear path forms around them, leading to the warehouse at the end of the docks.]",
        "Narrator: [Having safely passed the mob of wraiths, the sentinels arrive at the source of the local Harrowing: an old shipping warehouse.]",
        "Senna: Okay, sentinels. Looks like Viego’s holed up in this warehouse.",
        "Gwen: I can feel him, Miss. He’s gotten stronger since last time.",
        "Senna: I feel it, too. Everyone, make sure you’re ready.",
        "Pyke: Viego will chum the waters on this day.",
        "Lucian: Sarah, those pistols won’t protect you in there. Why don’t ya let me hold that fetter?",
        "Miss Fortune: Why? So you can take it and run? And leave me stewing in this mess? I’m not stupid, Lucian.",
        "Lucian: Maybe not stupid. But definitely paranoid.",
        "Senna: Just keep it out of sight, Sarah. And stay close to us. This is going to get hairy.",
        "Viego: Where are you, my love? Crate after crate I’ve opened, yet you are nowhere to be found.",
        "Viego: No matter. For our love, I would rummage through every stinking fish barrel on this island.",
        "Senna: Looking for something?",
        "Narrator: [Viego turns to see the sentinels, Pyke, and Miss Fortune with their weapons drawn.]",
        "Viego: Senna…",
        "Viego: ...at last you come before me, to offer your soul to the Last Great King of Camavor.",

        "Viego: You would really shoot me? Is that truly what SHE wants?",
        "Senna: ...",

        "Narrator: [Miss Fortune strolls toward Viego, coming between him and Senna’s gun.]",
        "Lucian: Sarah, what are you doing?",
        "Miss Fortune: I’m putting an end to all this.",

        "Miss Fortune: Let’s talk, King.",
        "Senna: Fortune! NO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!",
        "Viego: What is this? You come bearing gifts?",
        "Miss Fortune: That’s right. A piece of your missus. Just like you wanted.",
        "Miss Fortune: And as a little something extra, I come bearing another gift…",
        "Miss Fortune: ...all those troublesome sentinels who have been hounding you across Runeterra.",
        "Graves: WHAT?! Sarah, you low-down, back-stabbin’ sea krait!",
        "Graves: You are NOT gonna embarrass me in front of my new partners again!",
        "Diana: Why do you do this? You cannot resist his power. He will ruin you!",
        "Miss Fortune: Yes. I’m counting on it. That… is my last gift.",
        "Narrator: [You watch in horror as Miss Fortune turns her back to Viego, and spreads her arms wide, accepting what is to come.]",
        "Narrator: [Viego approaches her from behind, and—almost lovingly—runs his sword through her heart.]",
        "Gwen: Oh, my goodness… It’s okay! I can stitch that up! You’ll be right as rain!",
        "Miss Fortune: No, girl. This is my wish.",
        "Irelia: This is madness! I-I don’t understand.",
        "Miss Fortune: Like I said—you’re nice people…",
        "Miss Fortune: ...but I intend to get the spoils.",
        "Miss Fortune: Even if I have to share them.",
        "Viego: See how easy it is, Senna? You, too, can stop this futile struggle… and relinquish what is mine.",
        "Senna: I told you: I’d rather die!",
        "Narrator: [Senna angrily fires her cannon at Viego. Miss Fortune responds in kind.]",
        "Narrator: [Soon, gunlight and blunderbuss shot rip through the wooden crates and pallets in the warehouse. Shards of splintered wood fly like shrapnel in all directions.]",
        "Pyke: You. I have a question for you.",
        "Narrator: [You feel the blood rush from your head as Pyke fixes his dead gaze on you.]",
        "Pyke: That woman—Fortune… Is she now on my list?",
        "Pyke: Thank you.",
        "Narrator: [Pyke disappears into the shadows as gunshots continue to zip by your head.]",
        "Viego: See how your subjects fight over you, my queen. But none of them could ever grasp the depth of our love.",
        "Viego: Let us flee this vulgarity and continue our reunion.",
        "Narrator: [With a satisfied smirk, Viego pockets the bronze bell.]",
        "Gwen: Oh, dear. He’s leaving with the piece of her!",
        "Viego: Fret not, sentinels. I am not an unjust king.",
        "Viego: If you will not serve me, I will permit you to die with your freedom.",
        "Narrator: [With a single, mighty wave of his sword, Viego causes the warehouse to quake.]",
        "Gwen: What’s happening?!",
        "Narrator: [You hear the wood beneath your feet snapping and splashing into the bay below.]",
        "Olaf: That daft bastard is tearing apart the docks! He means to end Olaf’s saga with an epic drowning!",
        "Narrator: [Just as you draw the Wayfinder from its holster, a large beam of wood falls onto your shoulder, knocking the device from your grasp.]",
        "Narrator: [Before you can react, the falling Wayfinder skitters across the warehouse, then disappears through a hole in the collapsing floor.]",
        "Narrator: [Your heart sinks as you hear it splash into the bay below.]",
        "Lucian: Rookie! Son of a— What’s our plan B?!",

        "Miss Fortune: I’ve got a better idea…",
        "Miss Fortune: I like your spirit, kid.",
        "Miss Fortune: But spirit only gets you so far.",
        "Miss Fortune: The kid’s right.",
        "Miss Fortune: You’re all just going to sit here watching politely?",
        "Pyke: I must know! Is her name written on my list?",
        "Pyke: I must know! Is her name written on my list?",
        "Lucian: We’re way past that! Just Wayfinder us the hell outta here, Rook!",

        "Senna: [COUGH] [SPIT] ...Is everyone accounted for?",
        "Irelia: All except Pyke. He must have gone down with the docks.",

        "Narrator: [An unfriendly grip clinches your shoulder from behind. You turn to see Lucian, dripping with seawater, and steaming with anger.]",
        "Lucian: You had ONE job, Rookie!",
        "Lucian: Hold onto the Wayfinder and, when need be, Wayfind us out of trouble!",
        "Vayne: Lay off the kid!",
        "Lucian: Oh, NOW you wanna lay off the kid?",
        "Vayne: It wasn’t Rookie’s fault.",
        "Vayne: ...For once.",
        "Lucian: How are we supposed to get home without the Wayfinder? Walk?!",
        "Gwen: Hee. That’s silly. We’re on an island! We’d have to swim back.",
        "Senna: Yeah… I guess we need to talk transportation options. Who’s got ideas?",
        "Senna: Well, that leaves zero options, by my count.",
        "Diana: Sometimes no options IS an option.",
        "Rengar: [GRRRR] That makes Rengar’s brain hurt!",

        "Narrator: [You look around and see dozens of gun barrels aiming at you from behind the crates in the shipyard.]",
        "Lucian: Sarah… do you have any idea how much damage you’ve already done?",

        "Senna: How touching. You aren’t mad that we just took down Viego?",
        "Vex: Nah. I’m through with him. I thought Viego was cool at first because he was making everything dark and miserable…",
        "Vex: ...but he wanted it dark and miserable for all the wrong normie reasons. The guy was a complete fraud.",
        "Vex: You sentinels might be stupid tryhard normies, but at least you know what you are.",

        "Lucian: Senna… why’d you have to go?",
        "Lucian: Why the hell did I just sit there and watch you?",
        "Senna: Because you knew our love was strong enough. Strong enough for you to let me go.",

        "Maiden of the Mist: You bury her without a corpse?",
        "Yorick: A being is more than a physical form. You know this.",
        "Maiden of the Mist: She endured too much for far too long. She deserves peace.",
        "Yorick: As do you. And in time, you will know it.",
        "Gwen: What happened here? Did we miss all the wonderful fighting and screaming?",
        "Olaf: You should’ve seen it! We fought them blade to bone! Both axes did swing with the full fury of the Volibear Himself!",
        "Irelia: I never thought I’d say this, but… we owe much to this one here.",
        "Riven: Wait, are you talking about me?",

        "Irelia: That… was sarcasm.",
        "Riven: Hey, the Navori gets it!",
        "Gwen: So then, what about all the ghosty-green people? Are they still angry at us?",

        "Gwen: Wow. I must say this turned out rather splendidly.",
        "Senna: Yep. Score one for the sentinels. I’m looking forward to a two-day nap.",
        "Narrator: [You turn to take one last look at the Shadow Isles, your nose wrinkling in disgust at the vast amount of Harrowing that remains.]",
        "Senna: Good point. Sure is an awful lot of Harrowing lingering here.",
        "Rengar: Something evil is present, hoarding this Mist like food for winter.",
        "Lucian: Oh, boy. Cat’s on the trail of somethin’ again.",
        "Rengar: It is familiar, but… far stronger than any predator I have ever encountered. And it is close!",
        "Narrator: [You hear the clink of a chain approaching from a thick patch of Mist. A figure glides toward you, slowly stepping into the faint light of the Shadow Isles moon.]",

        "Lucian: Thresh.",
        "Senna: No…",
        "Vayne: Gotta say, he's not bad looking. Much less monstery than I thought he'd be.",
        "Thresh: I must confess, I have missed the feel of a corporeal form. For the first time in centuries, I feel... alive.",
        "Thresh: And I have these two to thank.",
        "Narrator: [You feel a cold shock wash over you as you realize Thresh is looking at you and Lucian.]",
        "Senna: Lucian? What is he talking about?",
        "Lucian: I…",
        "Thresh: Oh, don’t be coy, Lucian. Our tryst in Ixtal? A pact between traitors to the ruined crown?",
        "Thresh: It is the reason you stand here victorious and still living, is it not?",
        "Thresh: And the reason I now reign supreme in these isles.",
        "Senna: Lucian? Say something!",
        "Lucian: It’s not what you think, Senna. I just needed information! It was to protect you—",
        "Senna: So you partnered with THRESH? I... don’t believe this!",
        "Rengar: Do not forget Rengar! For I was involved, too, due to my extraordinary secret-keeping instincts!",
        "Rengar: Oh. I have just spoken the secret aloud, haven’t I? I feel shame.",
        "Senna: Unbelievable! What kind of sentinel team have I been leading?!",
        "Thresh: The kind who must now pay its debt.",
        "Lucian: Debt? What debt?",
        "Thresh: The soul you took from my lantern, of course.",
        "Lucian: Senna...",
        "Thresh: You didn’t really think I would forget about that little transgression, did you?",
        "Narrator: [Thresh raises his lantern toward Senna expectedly.]",
        "Lucian: Sentinels, what say we show this ol’ pretty boy how we treat someone who threatens our commander?",
        "Narrator: [The court erupts in flashes of rapid-fire gunlight, as every sentinel attacks Thresh.]",
        "Thresh: [LAUGHING]",
        "Narrator: [With a single wave of his scythe, Thresh knocks all of the sentinels backward, head over heels, into the barren, rocky earth.]",
        "Thresh: It seemed so easy, did it not? Thought you could cheat your way out of this with your cheap, relic-stone toys?",
        "Thresh: Petulent children—you have no idea the power I now hold.",
        "Thresh: Every bit of dark power wasted by that brooding egomaniac, I collected with great care.",
        "Thresh: So I ask again: Who will pay your debt?",
        "Narrator: [The sentinels look at each other with panicked uncertainty as Thresh extends his lantern once again.]",
        "Thresh: If I cannot get one, I will take you all. I’m really being as fair as I can possibly be.",
        "Lucian: I’ll go.",
        "Senna: What?! Lucian, stop!",
        "Lucian: I brought him here. This is my doing.",
        "Senna: That may be, and frankly, I am mad as hell at you, but I’m not letting you do this!",
        "Narrator: [You look around at the faces of your fellow sentinels, their thoughts visible on their faces.]",
        "Narrator: [Though none of them are cowards, all of them are terrified. You suddenly feel a heroic calling deep in your soul, and your next words flow from your mouth unbidden—]",
        "Senna: Rookie, NO!",
        "Thresh: Well, then. It appears I have my soul. Such a young soul, too.",
        "Thresh: Some may say it’s a waste, but I find my less experienced souls to be so much the sweeter.",
        "Narrator: [You look around at the other members of your order, silently pleading with you to reconsider.]",
        "Thresh: Come along then. Let’s not waste eternity.",
        "Narrator: [Before you can say farewell, Thresh thrusts his lantern toward you, and you feel yourself being sucked into a deep pit, darker than night itself.]",

        "Narrator: [With your last bit of cognizance, you remember... your WAYFINDER.]",
        "Narrator: [In a last-second act of desperation, you trigger the Wayfinder from inside Thresh’s lantern.]",
        "Narrator: [The darkness surrounding you is instantly replaced by a blinding light, and you fall endlessly through a snow-white void...]",
        "Narrator: [...until, finally, your eyes find color.]",
        "Lucian: Kid? ...KID! You’re awake!",
        "Senna: Hey, there you are! I knew you’d pull through.",
        "Lucian: You’re gonna have to face it, Rookie…",
        "Lucian: You’re a goddamn hero.",
        "Senna: So is everyone in this place. You’ve all held your own, and I couldn’t be more proud to call myself your leader!",
        "Gwen: So, what happens now? Are we to live together in this headquarters, like a big sentinel family?",
        "Diana: I’m afraid I must depart soon, Gwen. The Lunari need me. As does Targon.",
        "Diana: But in a way, we will see each other every night.",
        "Gwen: Oh, let’s! Shall we designate a meeting area?",
        "Diana: Just stand in the moonlight, Gwen. And I will be there.",
        "Irelia: I, too, must go. Ionia beckons.",
        "Irelia: The Land is still vulnerable, and I must be there to protect it.",
        "Riven: Oh. Well, I... hope to see you again, very soon.",
        "Irelia: More sarcasm.",
        "Riven: Nope. That was sincere.",
        "Irelia: ...",
        "Rengar: Rengar thanks you for restoring his confidence.",
        "Rengar: I have taken an impressive trophy to mount on the wall of my lair.",
        "Rengar: Whenever I look at it, I will remember how it once struck fear in me…",
        "Rengar: ...and how I overcame that fear to regain my place as the apex predator!",
        "Lucian: Good job, cat. What’d ya kill?",
        "Narrator: [Rengar reveals he’s holding what appears to be a severed wraith head.]",
        "Lucian: Oh. WOW! I did not know you could do that with wraiths. Learn somethin’ new every day.",
        "Senna: Well, Olaf—I know this mission wasn’t quite what you wanted.",
        "Olaf: It’s true. I’ve still not gotten my honorable death. But there is hope—I think I may have found a new capable foe!",
        "Pyke: Hey, axe-man. Did you really cut my line?",
        "Olaf: YES, I CUT ALL YOUR DAMN LINES! Now, are we gonna fight or keep talkin’ about it?!",
        "Graves: This sure was a memorable heist. Ain’t every day a man makes a new best bud.",
        "Vayne: For the last time, we are not buds. Let alone best ones.",
        "Graves: You say that, but we got a lot in common, you and me. Two peas in a pod.",
        "Vayne: Oh, no we don’t. I—am a seasoned monster slayer. And YOU—are a thieving lowlife. See the distinction?",
        "Graves: Awww, be fair now, Vayne. When was the last time you saw me thievin’?",
        "Vayne: Two minutes ago. When you walked out of the weapons vault with that rifle stashed under your coat.",
        "Narrator: [Sure enough, Graves pulls a sentinel rifle out of the back of his coat.]",
        "Graves: Oh. How’d that get in there?! Someone’s tryin’ to frame me for stealin’!",
        "Graves: Ah, who am I kiddin’? Yes, I’m stealin’ it, Vayne.",
        "Graves: And if you can’t accept that about me, well then, I reckon we ain’t meant to be best buds just yet.",
        "Vayne: That’s fine with me. Completely fine—",
        "Graves: When you come to your senses, look me up in Bilgewater. Bye now.",
        "Akshan: I suppose this is the part where I sneak off into the shadows.",
        "Lucian: Akshan… Thank you. For everything.",
        "Lucian: And good luck reviving Shadya.",
        "Akshan: I think the time has passed for that. Shadya must remain at rest.",
        "Akshan: But that is okay. It’s more important that I revive her ideas and continue her sentinel work.",
        "Akshan: That is how she can truly live forever.",
        "Senna: That’s very poignant. You know, for someone who disregards rules and regulations so much, you sure are a dependable—",
        "Lucian: He’s long gone, darlin’.",
        "Senna: Oh. Yeah, that’s on-character.",
        "Vayne: Looks like everyone’s gone. Guess this is the part where we all go back to our normal lives, huh?",
        "Senna: I don’t suppose I’ll have much of a normal life until I track down Thresh and put an end to him.",
        "Lucian: Guess that means I’ll be trackin’ him, too.",
        "Lucian: If I can find another sentinel to take my post in Demacia.",
        "Vayne: I thought you’d never ask.",
        "Vayne: You two track down newly handsome Thresh, and I’ll represent the sentinels in Demacia.",
        "Senna: Would the mageseekers approve of that? You being part of a secret organization that uses magic weapons?",
        "Vayne: Of course they wouldn’t.",

        "Gwen: Is Rookie wrong though?",
        "Lucian and Senna: ...",
        "Senna: Let’s get back to the easy stuff, like taking down Thresh.",
        "Lucian: Yeah, where do you reckon he ended up? I figured he’d have come here with us when Rookie used the Wayfinder.",
        "Senna: Bastard could be anywhere. We’ll find him.",
        "Thresh: Enjoy your little victory, sentinels...",
        "Thresh: ...for my lantern awaits you all.",
        "Lucian: Kid’s right. If we really stopped Viego, it shoulda stopped the Black Mist, too.",
        "Lucian: Yeah, the kid’s right. Shouldn’t this place be less ruined now?",
        "Lucian: Wait. Hold up…",
        "Lucian: If we stopped Viego, it shoulda stopped the Black Mist, too.",
        "Senna: You’re as much to blame as he is, Rookie!",

        "Vayne: Guess I’ll have to find someone else to slap.",
        "Senna: Yep. Every single one of them.",
        "Senna: You pulled everyone out of there with the Wayfinder, just in time.",
        "Graves: Wasn’t nuthin’ nearly that fun, kid.",

        "Lucian: At least let ‘em help you.",

        "Gwen: Look, everyone! Isn’t she just the height of marvelousness? The sentinel gold really brings out her luminosity!",

        "Narrator: [Lucian suddenly looks uncomfortable.]",
        "Lucian: Uhh. I meant, stand in the… Moon… light? Or fall in… darkness? Not darkness as in night. I’ve got nothin’ against night! Dammit.",
        "Lucian: There’s no way of makin’ that sound better, huh?",
        "Diana: It’s fine. I do not take offense. Many are ignorant of celestial matters.",
        "Diana: The light of the moon fights the darkness, too.",
        "Diana: It is no different than sunlight. In fact, it is all the same light.",

        "Lucian: I, uh… filled him in on the way here.",

        "Senna: I don’t know, Lucian.",
        "Lucian: This… THIS is why I said you should stay away from him. You’re too important, and there’s a lot we don’t know here. Let the others do the fighting!",
